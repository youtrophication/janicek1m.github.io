                <h6>Motivation</h6>
                <p>There are a bevy of different social actions in the form of governmental policy or non-government assistance programs that influence the world’s ability to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 8. Especially in the context of developing
                    region such as sub-Saharan Africa, it is critical to examine potential actions that may pay large dividends in economic growth and/or availability of decent work. Providing access to family planning services and contraception represents
                    a uniquely interesting and sensitive example of an action that could be taken to work towards SDG 8.</p>
                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>This paper examines reasoning for the promotion of family planning methods in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It makes the economic argument that higher contraceptive usage rates are strongly correlated with the presence of decent jobs in countries,
                    using economic growth, unemployment rate, and wage rate as indicators. The article examines two distinct sets of rationale for higher contraceptive usage – first, the argument that lower fertility should be promoted to capitalize on
                    unique current demographic trends in SSA, and second, the argument that lower fertility enhances female workforce participation. The paper concludes with brief recommendations on future action to reduce unaffordability and stigma surrounding
                    family planning in SSA. The article utilizes empirical data and predictive analysis from a variety of sources, including international governing bodies, non-governmental organizations, and scholarly journals. The data examined in the
                    article spans both research specific to SSA and broader trends.</p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>Currently, plentiful research exists on the necessity of access to reliable methods of contraception to further Sustainable Development Goals 3, 4, and 5, access to healthcare, access to education, and gender equality. The positive impact
                    of contraceptives towards furthering the aforementioned goals is obvious – multiple rigorous studies have concluded availability of contraceptives lowers morality, morbidity, and sexually-transmitted infection rates, allows women to
                    access education, and grants women access to social freedom and power.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a></sup> However, the potential of contraceptives to economically benefit developing nations, specifically sub-Saharan
                    Africa (SSA), has been greatly understated.</p>
                <p>Even marginal increases in levels of contraceptive usage would have powerful impacts on fertility rates, which refers to the average number of births per woman in a given population. Given that almost half of births occurring among women
                    between ages 15-24 are unintentional, Hubacher, Mavranezouli, and McGinn concluded if just 1 percent of women not currently using a form of contraceptive adopted a highly effective method similar to an implant, the number of prevented
                    unintended pregnancies could surpass 2 million.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>The current lack of safe, affordable, and socially accepted contraceptive methods in sub-Saharan Africa represents both a large challenge and opportunity for improvement in promoting decent employment for youth in alignment with Sustainable
                    Development Goal 8. Even minor improvements in contraceptive availability and stigmatization can aid SSA’s economic development, improve the abilities of women to access formal employment, and increase the overall amount of decent
                    jobs available in the region.</p>
                <h6>Discussion</h6>
                <p>To promote available decent work, economic growth must be prioritized. Abundant evidence points to a strong complementary correlation between economic development and the availability of decent jobs. Fields’ analysis of a series of East
                    Asian countries with the highest growth rates found that within 30 years, real earnings were four times greater in Hong Kong, six times greater in the Republic of Korea, and eight times greater in Taiwan. In each case, unemployment
                    rates were extremely low, between 2 to 4 percent. Correlatively, his analysis of six Latin American countries found that their anemic growth rates manifested themselves in shockingly high unemployment rates (14 percent in Chile and
                    13 percent in Venezuela) or declines in real earnings (20 percent in Mexico, 32 percent in Brazil, 47 percent in Venezuela, and 58 percent in Bolivia)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Both high real wages
                    and low unemployment indicate a higher likelihood decent work will be available.</p>
                <p>In sub-Saharan Africa, demographic trends provide a unique opportunity for further economic growth in the region. About half of SSA’s population is under 18 years of age.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup> In the
                    near future, SSA’s youth demographic will continue to be notably large in comparison to the rest of the world; the median age in SSA will be only 20.1 by 2030 and 24.9 in 2055, in comparison to almost 35 worldwide<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</p>
                <p>The population structure of sub-Saharan Africa is specifically notable for its “youth bulge” – a demographic distribution structure that represents a decreasing proportion of people who are members of older age groups. There are more individuals
                    in the 0-4 category than the 10-14 category, more individuals in the 10-14 category than the 20-24 category, and so on<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. The youth bulge of SSA’s population suggests that the
                    working-age population will continue to grow in the future, as the large populations of children and adolescents ages into young adults. </p>
                <p>The specific conditions of sub-Saharan Africa’s demographics represent an opportunity for capitalization. The rapid expansion of SSA’s potential workforce in the large proportion of youth mirrors the same conditions that allowed for East
                    Asia’s economic revitalization in the second half of the 20th century. Between 1965 and 1990, the working-age population of the broader East Asia and Pacific region doubled from 541 million to 1.039 billion. Perhaps more critically,
                    since the number of dependents, people aged 0-14 and 65+, increased by only 143 million, providing a ratio of almost two working-age adults to each dependent<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Analysis by Bloom
                    and Williamson attributed as much as one-third to one-half of East Asia’s economic miracle to a favorable demographic<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Causally, the World Bank hypothesizes that two specific
                    factors allowed East Asia to transform their demography into economic dividends. First, faster growth of the youth population created a large pool of workers. Second, a higher ratio of working-age adults to dependents reduced the burden
                    of dependents and thus promoted the growth of per-capita income<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</p>
                <p>Regarding sub-Saharan Africa, capitalizing upon a large proportion of youth and working-age adults is not possible at the population structure’s current rate of change. For per-capital income to exhibit an increasing trend like in East
                    Asia, the ratio of dependents to the working-age population must fall. In other words, the current youth bulge trend of the highest percent of the population being members of the 0-14 age group cannot continue for SSA to experience
                    an economic revitalization similar to East Asia’s; fertility rates must fall. </p>
                <p>The benefits of reducing fertility rates extend beyond favorable demographic development, though the promotion of specific demographic conditions would further economic growth and thus would represent an improvement in quality of life
                    in itself. Especially for young women, reducing the rate of unwanted and/or accidental pregnancies has been found to have strong effects on the ability to sustain oneself economically and the ability to obtain a decent job. Beyond
                    the dependency ratio, the high rate of adolescent parenthood in SSA has further economic and social consequences in serving as a barrier for adolescent women to obtain formal employment, especially in jobs that may be considered decent.</p>
                <p>Young women who become pregnant are less likely to complete their educations and have less economic power than those who have children at an older age. Researchers from the Population and Poverty Research Network found that in metropolitan
                    Cape Town, South Africa, having a child before the age of 17 equated to receiving 1.26 less years of schooling<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Another study conducted in Madagascar which controlled for
                    both nonrandom selection and the cyclical nature of high rates of fertility and low rates of education found that adolescent mothers were 42 percent more likely to drop out of school<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.
                    A lower level of schooling may prevent women who are or were young mothers from gaining a decent job with a higher wage rate or restricts them to employment in the informal sectors or in care work.</p>
                <p>In the context of economic growth, an analysis by Bloom, Canning, Fink, and Finlay across multiple countries found a strong association between higher fertility rates and lower female workforce participation. The results implied that within
                    the 20-39 age group, for each additional child borne, female workforce participation decreased by 10-15 percent, a reduction of about four years of paid work for each child<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.
                    Not only do high fertility rates prevent women from obtaining the level of education that may assure them a decent job, but sometimes denies them opportunities to participate in the labor force altogether.</p>
                <p>Along with the unfavorable ratios of dependents to working-age adults discussed previously, the low rates of workforce participation for women caused by high fertility represents massive lost productivity for sub-Saharan countries. Unplanned
                    and/or unwanted pregnancies not only impact the size of a country’s potential labor force, they also reduce opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship by preventing women from receiving education needed to develop new ideas
                    that may create economic growth in the future. </p>
                <p>Both conclusions about sub-Saharan Africa’s current demography and the potential of an increased rate of female workforce participation find that lower fertility rates are markedly economically beneficial for both economic growth and the
                    availability of decent employment. Therefore, access to family planning services is absolutely beneficial towards the goals of achieving more widespread and more decent jobs for youth.</p>
                <p>In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 is 109. The figure is stark in comparison to both the statistic in high-income countries, which is 22, and the world statistic, which is 46<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a></sup>
                    <sup id="fnref:14">
                        <a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>. Importantly, the Guttmacher Institute estimates that around half (49 percent) of pregnancies of adolescents aged 15-19 are unintended, proving the potential of a large positive impact given more access
                    to widespread contraception
                    <sup id="fnref:15">
                            <a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"></a>
                            </sup>. Indeed, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a high unmet demand for contraceptives. United Nations data places the unmet need for contraceptives in SSA as 24 percent, twice the 2015 world
                    average
                    <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Similarly, Hubacher, Mavranezouli, and McGinn found over 90 percent of youth in SSA had knowledge of some form of birth control, but only one-third had ever utilized contraceptives
                    <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</p>
                <p>Many potential barriers could explain the vast unbridged gap between demand and actual access. In sub-Saharan Africa specifically, there are often high costs associated with obtaining reliable, modern contraceptives. Beyond financial costs,
                    which can be associated with the costs of transportation, missed time at work, etc.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote"></a></sup>, costs can be broadly defined to include social costs, which are a significant factor
                    in SSA. Though difficult to quantify, social unacceptability, ambivalence, and insufficient or incorrect knowledge play large roles in the low rates of contraception usage in many SSA countries, even in situations where government
                    subsidies and/or assistance from non-governmental organizations exist. Erroneous beliefs in side effects or an unwillingness to admit ignorance are prevalent especially in situations like in SSA, where many family planning programs
                    are in their early stages.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>To alleviate both financial and social concerns, investment must be made towards continuing to promote the safety, success, and affordability of contraceptives. Not only do policies and assistance measures need to be formulated so they
                    specifically serve adolescents, a uniquely vulnerable population that benefits the most from access to birth control, but investment in preventive sex education must be made. Evidence-based sex education, whether offered through traditional
                    schooling formats, individual interventions by trained workers, or another method, may go a long way towards eradicating the stigma that has greatly affected efficacy of current interventions in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>The economic rationale for action from both governmental bodies and aid organizations on increasing contraceptive usage rates is clear. First, sub-Saharan Africa’s current demography represents a powerful opportunity for the region to
                    initiate a similar economic miracle to East Asia’s in the latter half of the 20th century. However, in order for trends of economic growth, which is strongly related to the availability of decent work, to emerge, fertility rates must
                    decrease. Second, for young women in SSA between the ages of 15-19, unplanned pregnancy significantly reduces their chances of obtaining a decent job. Not only does it reduce their ability to participate in the workforce, it also prevents
                    them from accessing education, reducing the likelihood that they will obtain higher-paid work in the future and participate in innovation.</p>
                <p>Governments and non-governmental organizations must take strong action to reduce the gap between the youth in sub-Saharan African seeking access to family planning services and those who are able to obtain it. Organizations working towards
                    economic improvement and the availability of decent jobs must prioritize addressing both fiscal and social costs associated with obtaining contraceptives through a variety of financial and educational methods.</p>
