                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>While workforce development initiatives are often designed from the top-down, a human-centered approach calls for decision-making authority on economic policies to be shared with the communities engaged – an approach which social entrepreneurs
                    have been bringing to their work for decades. Echoing Green, an organization with thirty years of experience investing and support the growth of early-stage social entrepreneurs, has observed this approach succeed time-and-time again.
                    To do this work well requires investment in community leaders deeply embedded in the constituencies they serve. Impact Experience, recipients of the 2018 Echoing Green Fellowship, have brought a human centered approach to their work
                    with twenty communities across the United States on themes from climate resilience, community cohesion, and ecosystem building - all within a framework of building a more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable workforce and workplace.
                    This paper highlights the progress and successes from Impact Experience’s work in Williamson, West Virginia – a town working to overcome challenges stemming from the decline of the coal industry – to both show the viability of Impact
                    Experience’s local organizing model as well as illuminate the contributions social entrepreneurship can make to promote an inclusive future of work.</p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>In the report “Work for a Brighter Future,” the International Labour Organization called for a human-centered agenda to ensure the future of work is designed to “drive growth, equity, and sustainability for present and future generations.”
                    <sup id="fnref:1">
                        <a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> To achieve the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth – will require a systemic coalition of effort across all sectors and industries.</p>
                <p>Social entrepreneurship – and the leaders who represent this movement of socially conscious businesses and non-profit organizations – have been on the front lines of implementing impact-first and human-centered design work for decades.
                    With proper investment, social entrepreneurs can build equitable and locally sustainable organizations whose primary measurement of success is their ability to transform their constituents and communities for the better. As other industries
                    seek to bring this perspective into their work, social entrepreneurs can be an invaluable resource.</p>
                <p>To steward the future of work, Echoing Green believes that the global community must not only strengthen people’s rights and opportunities in economies as they exist today, but also invest heavily in leaders with a vision for what the
                    economies and societies of the future must become. Social entrepreneurs are leading the way towards a future of work that is equitable and designed to meet human needs first and foremost. These leaders already exist in communities
                    throughout the world. With support, they are ready to build new, collaborative alternatives to address worker displacement, combat climate change, challenge the centralization of wealth and power, and empower those repressed by gender,
                    racial, and other forms of systemic social oppression.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Impact Experience is an example of one such organization. Impact Experience is a social impact organization focused on building bridges and deepening relationships between impact investors, philanthropists, entrepreneurs and community
                    leaders to co-develop solutions that align with the community’s vision. Through their work in Williamson, West Virginia, they have engaged in a community-driven process to design an equitable and inclusive future for the city, already
                    attracting more than $8 million USD in new funding, including capital for initiatives on workforce development, healthcare and wellness, and community facilities and creating nearly 300 jobs. Their successes represent the potential
                    of inclusive social entrepreneurship; a model we believe can make positive change if implemented across the world.</p>
                <h6>Disucssion</h6>
                <p>In Williamson, West Virginia, over 2,000 coal workers – nearly 25% of the town’s workforce – have lost their jobs since 2014. The decline of the coal industry and a lack of sustainable alternatives has left many people uncertain about
                    their day-to-day financial stability and has contributed to a growing public health crisis in the area. Mingo County, where Williamson is located, struggles with some of the highest rates of diabetes, hypertension, and opioid abuse
                    in the United States.</p>
                <p>In response to these challenges, Impact Experience has brought together the Williamson community, investors, philanthropists, and innovators in a series of workshops to co-develop the future of the city in an equitable and inclusive way.
                    By bringing together diverse stakeholders to co-create a citywide development, Impact Experience demonstrated an innovative and collaborative approach to drafting inclusive economic policy. Over the course of five years, they worked
                    to generate trust amongst one another through a series of facilitated conversations that explored implicit bias and aligned personal and professional values– a necessary step for the Williamson community who experienced years of economic
                    extraction and outside interests with little investment in the long-term wellbeing of their community. The trust-building phase was critical to ensure that any economic development plans would respect their community’s values as well
                    as Appalachian culture, heritage, and history.</p>
                <p>This trust developed into a working partnership where all participants contributed to the creation of a citywide development plan. Utilizing facilitation tools such as consensus building and design thinking, they co-identified challenges
                    to the community as well as opportunities to address them. Beyond simply having surface-level conversations, Impact Experience emphasized the need to have deep conversations about how to build an equitable, inclusive, and sustainable
                    workforce. Some of the key questions explored include:</p>

                    ul:nth-of-type(1) {
                        list-style-type: disc;
                    }
                    
                    .tab {
                        margin-left: 70px;
                    }
                </style>
                <p class="tab">
                    <ul class="tab">
                        <li>What defines quality work for your community?</li>
                        <li>What new skills are required for a new labor force to partake in dignified work?</li>
                        <li>How can our development plan ensure that people across race, class, and socioeconomic status are engaged, respected, and provided with opportunities?</li>
                        <li>How does technological innovation help or disrupt an existing labor-market dynamic?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>By delving into difficult topics and engaging a variety of stakeholders with established trust, the group was able to express their needs, generate insights, identify resources, and discover areas of expertise that might otherwise have
                    gone unrealized. At the end of this collaborative design process, the community emerged with a roadmap to diversify the local economy, develop the workforce needed to implement it, and ensure that accountability and ownership was vested
                    in local leaders so the solutions could be controlled by the community and sustained long-term. The Impact Experience model serves as a replicable solution for rolling out a multistakeholder approach to map SDG 8 targets at a local
                    level. </p>
                <p>Acting on the development plan, the Williamson community and external stakeholders supported the development of a Federally Qualified Healthcare Center, a health innovation hub, and a mobile farmers market – generating nearly 300 jobs
                    for former coal workers as well as serving the health needs of over 20,000 patients who live under the poverty line. Impact Experience helped attract an additional $8 million USD for projects ranging from workforce development in the
                    health and solar energy industries, broadband infrastructure projects, and investment in ecotourism projects. As a result, the Williamson community has been able to achieve the following outcomes:</p>

                        <li><strong>Rural Healthcare</strong>: the development of the Williamson Health and Wellness Center, a Federally Qualified Healthcare Center that provides over 20,000 local residents across Mingo County with comprehensive healthcare
                            and wellness programs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wellness Programs</strong>: local healthcare leaders are building several programs including a diabetes intervention program, mobile farmers market, and a new fitness center.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Facilities</strong>: the Williamson Health and Wellness Center purchased a new facility with meeting spaces, providing community members with the opportunity to connect with entrepreneurs who are supporting the
                            growth of the local economy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Williamson, West Virginia demonstrates what the future of work will look like: a broader shift away from traditional extraction economies towards new, innovative and sustainable industries. The future of work will require us to follow
                    their lead, rethinking and redefining what it means to work, how to build a workforce, and what comprises a dignified workplace.</p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>To truly reframe the future of work, investment must be made in leaders willing to challenge the practices of existing, exploitative industries and build the economies of the future – implemented in full, contextual understanding of how
                    disruptions to current economic systems can have detrimental effects, particularly in oppressed communities which all too often shoulder the burden. </p>
                <p>Impact Experience’s engagement approach of generating trust among diverse stakeholders, building consensus for a collaboratively designed strategy, and ensuring local sustainability is applicable to communities across the globe. Their
                    model and experience in doing this work is illustrative of multiple recommendations that should be adopted across the ecosystem of institutions involved in workforce development.</p>
                <p>First, policy makers should be consistently engaging diverse stakeholders across multiple sectors to collaboratively envision the future of the community. This helps guarantee that work and workforce development is owned and shaped by
                    community leaders with a robust network of resources – both financial and human capital – behind them. Without a strong network of support that bridges across sectors, disciplines, and geographical regions, historically marginalized
                    communities will continue to bear the burden of structural inequalities designed to suppress the potential to obtain decent work, steady income, and a sustainable livelihood.</p>
                <p>Second, to fulfill the ILO’s vision of implementing human-centered design to improve the future of work, governments, investors, foundations and philanthropy should look to, elevate, and partner to deploy the solutions social entrepreneurs
                    are building across the world. In particular, social entrepreneurs who display a commitment to equity, a focus on sustainability, and, perhaps most importantly, who are building organizations designed to grant power and decision-making
                    authority to the constituents whom they represent and serve.</p>
                <p>Third, increased investment in early-stage social enterprises led by local leaders, deeply invested in their communities’ unique needs, is needed to drive change and achieve SDG 8.3. Innovation cannot be entrusted to institutions with
                    embedded financial and social stakes in the continuation of a harmful or biased status quo. What Impact Experience, in collaboration with local partners accomplished, in Williamson, West Virginia – and what social entrepreneurs across
                    the world strive to accomplish every day – serves as an example and a model for an evolved future of work where businesses and organizations center equity, sustainability, and human needs at the very core of their operations. As trends
                    in both the nonprofit and for-profit sectors point towards an increased centralization of economic power<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup>, social entrepreneurship serves as a counterexample: vesting power
                    and financial resources in can deliver transformational impact.</p>
                <p>Echoing Green’s research has found that social enterprises pursue funds across the spectrum of possible sources, regardless of corporate form. This underscores the importance of funders’ and investors’ work to design fair, inclusive processes
                    as they determine who and what to fund<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup>, including the creation of new models of risk assessment for investment in innovative solutions be developed. These new, innovative organizations
                    understand that traditional risk assessment that focuses solely on economic growth is shortsighted, knowing that the social, environmental and economic challenges of today will be far costlier to address if the problems are left to
                    grow worse. Social entrepreneurs understand that success must not be defined solely in terms of profitability or financial stability – a framework often implemented to prevent investment in areas desperately in-need of such support
                    – but must prioritize how investments improve the lives of people.</p>
                <p>Whether it is in West Virginia, New York City, or Nairobi, social entrepreneurs in Echoing Green’s community are already calling for change when it comes to the future of work. In a roundtable discussion with more than 10 NYC-based Fellows
                    in 2017, these key issues and ideas were apparent in the conversation and a final report, “How will New York City Define the Future of Work?”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup> in partnership with Barclays.
                    Putting people at the center of these workforce solutions is the key to overcoming our challenges, no matter where they live.</p>
                <p>Social entrepreneurship has the potential to reshape the future of work and strengthen the social contract where existing economic structures have fallen short – yet it will not do so without global support and a willingness to thoughtfully
                    transition economic power and decision-making toward community-based leadership.</p>
                <p>The good news is that leaders willing and knowledgeable about how to do so already exist – they are willing and able to begin their work today, if given the critical support they need. In addition to financial investment and resources,
                    we must create a community of learning and support for next generation leaders who are building and operating the businesses that are on the front lines of creating new, socially responsible businesses dedicated to racial, economic,
                    and social justice. This transformation will not happen overnight: it is a long-term investment in the development of leaders who, day by day, do the important work of building a new, collaborative and sustainable economy. </p>
