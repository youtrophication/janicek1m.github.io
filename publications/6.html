                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>Cross-boundary innovation teams, composed of internal and external team members, are collectively smarter than teams composed only of internal employees. This paper uses McGrath’s Circumplex Model of Group Tasks to analyze the activities
                    that innovation teams need to complete in order to develop new products or processes. The team’s ability to complete the identified tasks is then assessed using the Entrepreneurial Muscle Memory Seven Core Competencies model. Optimizing
                    the team’s collective intelligence leads to a focus on a core competency, defined as agency. The innovation competency is demonstrated through confidence in one’s ability to instigate and drive change and is critical when moving beyond
                    idea to execution. Available data shows that agency is lacking among employees of large organizations and tends to be frequent among small business and startup team members. Eliminating organizational boundaries when building an innovation
                    team can increase the team’s capacity to carry out an innovation initiative. Such a construct can enable linkages between big and small businesses, ultimately generating profits and creating jobs for both entities. Ultimately, something
                    as simple as linking team members across businesses of different sizes can be an important business and policy tool to distribute economic growth.</p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>With 84% of executives considering innovation as the core of their company’s growth, only 6% report being satisfied with the outcome of their innovation initiatives.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a></sup> For large
                    companies, infusing the corporate culture with risk-taking and entrepreneurialism is now recognized as a survival need, making innovation teams ubiquitous across organizations. Most companies consider themselves in the early stages
                    of innovation maturity,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup> presenting the need and opportunity for novel frameworks that can potentially increase the success of innovation endeavors.</p>
                <p>Open innovation, enabling companies to use external input in addition to their in-house R&D and innovation resources, is a growing trend. Despite being the comparatively least utilized method, multiple studies demonstrate positive outcomes
                    and significant future potential of open innovation initiatives.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup> A 2018 BCG Henderson Institute report shows that companies satisfied with their innovation performance manage
                    to run and reinvent the business at the same time, while fostering collaboration with both internal and external partners.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Another study concludes that 74% of companies successful
                    in developing innovative services use a mixture of internal and external innovation drivers.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Operationalizing open innovation starts with an understanding that high-value work increasingly happens in teams.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a></sup> The Fourth Industrial Revolution has decreased the value of individual
                    cognitive abilities, while demonstrating the effect of synergistic team performance.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup> This paper examines open innovation on a team level, using a competency-based approach
                    to analyze tasks teams need to complete throughout the innovation process. The core hypothesis presented is that collectively smarter innovation teams are comprised of both internal and external team members.</p>

                <p>To analyze the innovation process on a team level, we need to first understand the concept of collective intelligence. Woolley et al. empirically validated the claim that teams possess collective intelligence. The authors found evidence
                    of collective intelligence that can be measured, comparable to the way individual intelligence is assessed. The collective intelligence of a team is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum intelligence of individuals in
                    the group.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Pea analyzed intelligence as manifested through activity and not as a state of being. He developed the concept of distributed intelligence, arguing that activity
                    is enabled beyond the intelligence contributed by an individual.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Next, we demonstrate the link between tasks the innovation team needs to complete and the underlying competencies. We use McGrath’s Circumplex Model of Group Tasks to analyze intelligence through different stages of group activity. In
                    order to understand the competencies needed to successfully carry out innovation tasks, we look at the Entrepreneurial Muscle Memory (EMM) Seven Core Competencies model. Using the two frameworks provides an insight into how individual
                    competencies enable activity and relate to the collective intelligence of an innovation team.</p>
                <p>McGrath provides a conceptual framework for the study of groups, classifying main group tasks into four basic categories of processes: generate, choose, negotiate, and execute.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    His model is shown in Figure 1 below.</p>

                <p>The Entrepreneurial Muscle Memory (EMM) Framework provides an understanding of critical traits that drive most successful innovations and a method to assess individuals against those traits.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    The seven core EMM competencies are outlined in Table 1.</p>

                <p>Next, we look at McGrath’s four categories of group tasks as they relate to innovation initiatives, examining idea generation, selection, transition, and execution.</p>
                <h6>Idea generation: building a strategic plan and brainstorming </h6>
                <p>The first stage of the innovation process is connected to the “generate” section of McGrath’s model. Generating plans is frequently a weak point in the innovation pipeline. As it requires an innovation strategy, it goes beyond the sole
                    notion that innovation is necessary to stay relevant. As Pisano phrases it, this stage needs a thorough “understanding and articulation of specific objectives related to helping the company achieve a sustainable competitive advantage.”
                    <sup id="fnref:12">
                        <a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> Teams at this stage need to use their awareness and problem-solving skills to identify factors related to creating, delivering, and capturing value with the end-customer in mind. The stage also requires
                    strong agency and communication skills to build a feasible plan despite obstacles and a clear manner of communicating that plan.</p>
                <p>Planning tends to be followed by generating ideas, a part that most innovation teams perform well on, using ideation sessions, hackathons, and workshops as methods. Generating ideas is closely linked to a strong sense of awareness, an
                    ability to spot opportunities, and problem-solving, or tendency to dig under the surface. Generating ideas is rarely an obstacle. Employees end up frustrated afterwards, when there is no tangible outcome upon completion of the idea
                    generation session.</p>
                <h6>Idea selection: assessing technical and business feasibility</h6>
                <p>The second part of the innovation team process is linked to the “choosing” portion of the McGrath model. Using team members’ technical and functional expertise to solve problems with correct answers requires strong analytical and problem-solving
                    skills. To complete this stage successfully, it is important to have the right technical and functional experts on board. Deciding issues with no right answer requires slightly more than problem-solving skills. Dealing with the type
                    of situations when the correct answer is the preferred or agreed upon one, requires both strong problem-solving and communication skills. Corporate innovation teams, in general, tend to perform well on this category of tasks.</p>
                <h6>Idea transition: team alignment and negotiation</h6>
                <p>Bringing individuals across disciplines, geographies, and organizations requires having people on board who can be effective at handling the next stage of the innovation team workflow: “negotiating.” Resolving conflicts of viewpoint requires
                    excellent communication skills and the ability to put oneself in others’ shoes. Resolving conflicts of interest additionally requires strong relationship-building skills. The study by Woolley et al. found that collective intelligence
                    of teams is “correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    The finding does not come as a surprise as individuals with strong communication and networking tendencies are more likely to exhibit that type of behavior, therefore contributing to the successful completion of tasks related to team
                    alignment and negotiation. </p>
                <h6>Idea execution: resolving power struggles and enhancing performance</h6>
                <p>Before getting to see the light of day, new ideas and plans need to go through bureaucratic hurdles and overcome power struggles. Resolving conflicts of power can be frequent when an innovation initiative threatens to make jobs or departments
                    obsolete. The stage requires superior communication skills (sharing benefits of the initiative), networking (getting stakeholders’ buy-in), resourcefulness (operating within multiple constraints) and ultimately resilience (not getting
                    discouraged by rejection).</p>
                <p>Finally, executing an idea is when most initiatives fail. This “last” stage of the model requires people with a strong sense of agency or belief in one’s ability to successfully drive change. An intriguing trend appears when analyzing
                    data from 220 entrepreneurial competency assessment results by the Entrepreneurial Muscle Lab (EML). Less than 5% of individuals working at a large company with over 1000 employees have agency as their leading competency, while close
                    to 40% have it as their relatively weakest one. On the other hand, 25% of individuals working at a startup or a small business (below 1000 employees) have agency as their leading competency with 9% having it as their weakest one.
                    <sup id="fnref:14">
                        <a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>
                </p>
                <p>Agency appears to increase in frequency as the organizational size decreases. Further research is needed to understand whether the trend is due to self-selection or corporate bureaucracy stifling individuals’ sense of agency. As a competency
                    that significantly influences the capacity to generate and execute innovation plans, agency could be the missing link that unlocks the power of innovation teams.</p>
                <p>The model is represented in an apparent chronological order for simplicity. In reality, most of these tasks may be occurring concurrently, and there can be multiple iterations of different processes.</p>
                <h6>Discussion</h6>
                <p>Innovation teams composed of team members spanning organizational boundaries tend to have complementary competencies needed to complete different group processes. The enhanced ability to complete group tasks can be interpreted as a signal
                    of an increased collective intelligence. Analyzing the innovation team as a separate construct allows us to assess and optimize team structures for increased performance. Previous studies have already shown that using both internal
                    and external resources in an innovation process leads to improved innovation outcomes. The paper further confirmed the finding, focusing on the use of internal and external human capital. </p>
                <p>Cross-boundary team structures present a unique opportunity to create synergies between big and small businesses. For large organizations, it is a chance to infuse attitudes such as agility, proactivity, risk-taking, and entrepreneurialism.
                    For small businesses, such close collaboration provides access to platforms of scale, industry know-how, and the advantage that comes with high market power. Eliminating organizational boundaries when forming an innovation team can
                    enhance both organizations’ capability to drive change, build new products and services.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, optimizing the distributed intelligence of individuals across organizations is a potential win-win scenario, generating profits and creating new jobs on both ends. Demonstrating the business case for investing in collaboration
                    with smaller enterprises can incentivize large business to reimagine the concept of what constitutes a workforce. On the small business side, establishing the external team member connection can decrease the fear in working with a
                    significantly more powerful partner. If properly utilized, cross-boundary team structures can act as an equalizer, creating individual linkages that enable big – small business collaboration.</p>
                <p>Cross-boundary team creation still poses a number of challenges, including transparency, Intellectual Property ownership, coordination, common goals, and underlying drivers’ identification. Further research is needed to understand environmental
                    factors that influence teams’ performance. Empirically validating the correlation between competencies and tasks completion can also support the practical implementation of the proposed concept.</p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>Examining open innovation on a team level shows that cross-boundary teams have an enhanced ability to complete innovation-related group tasks. The paper aimed to demonstrate that a construct as simple as forming a team has the potential
                    to contribute to innovation, productivity, and economic output. Further understanding the practical application of cross-boundary team formation can become a core business advantage.</p>
                <p>Cross-boundary team structures could eliminate communication and incentive barriers between big and small businesses, enabling them to help each other grow. Combining individuals’ capabilities and drive could render organizational divides
                    obsolete. Business tools and policy instruments that foster such connections can help design a collaborative future of work. Let us start with a dialogue on how big and small players can not only co-exist but thrive together. </p>
