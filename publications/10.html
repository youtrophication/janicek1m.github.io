                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>Young people in Bangladesh face a precarious future, despite living in one of the world’s fastest growing economies. According to the UN report, Bangladesh will be the third fastest growing economy in the world, achieving a Gross Domestic
                    Product (GDP) of 7.4% in 2019.The future of work presents countless opportunities to reverse long-term decent work deficits, but it also presents serious challenges that could increase inequalities and joblessness if not well managed.
                    With more than 64 million unemployed youth worldwide and 145 million young workers living in poverty, youth employment remains a global challenge. How well countries adapt to such changes will be a major determinant in the achievement
                    of the Sustainable Development Goals. Southeast Asia is booming with young populations but one in five workers of Asia are working above ten hours a day but living below the poverty line. Technology is starting to take a heavy toll
                    on the youth employment due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this critical situation, marginalized youth are the most vulnerable as most of them have poor access to skills development opportunities. This article focuses on understanding
                    the transactions of digitalization as it relates to the perspective of marginalized youth. By analyzing the context of Bangladesh, this article explores obstacles of achieving SDG goals by 2030 and analyzes the prospects for the marginalized
                    youth community in the future global job market.
                </p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>For marginalized youth living in Asia, data shows that, young people ages 15–24 who make up 22% of the world’s adult population often face great challenges in finding employment.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    In the case of marginalized youth even if they secure work most of the time the work is in jobs that are physically demanding and pay less than livable wage. Moreover, it is not just about creating employment but generating decent
                    work for all, in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 8. For example, in many developing Asian countries like Bangladesh, workers are working in the labor-intensive sectors to find the opportunity to earn some income
                    in the digital gig economy, such as being an Uber driver. Such labour platforms offer opportunities to earn money, but at what cost? Potential fallbacks include long working hours, low wages, low job security, increasing competition
                    for low-skill jobs. Bangladesh, similar to many developing nations of Southeast Asia, is still struggling to incorporate the informal labor sector within the provisions of national labor law.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>Bangladesh has sustained strong economic growth in the last decade and has gone through massive technological, social and infrastructural transformation. At this point of time it is undeniable that the future of work is technology-based,
                    which will allow many skilled people to have decent job. At the same time this technological dependency will also cause unemployment or joblessness, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. If not managed properly this may
                    cause serious consequences for marginalized youth communities and for the overall economic development of Bangladesh. How countries deal with youth unemployment is linked to determining their future of work along with their progress
                    in achieving SDG 8. This article will cover issues concerning the future of work from the perspective of marginalized youth living in Bangladesh.</p>
                <h6>The Economic Context of Bangladesh</h6>
                <p> Data from the World Bank shows that young people in low-income countries are more likely to have some kind of job compared to young people in middle- and high-income countries.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    Young people in Bangladesh, especially marginalized youth, are compelled to help support their families to the extent that many drop out of school prematurely and end up in precarious and low productivity employment with few opportunities
                    for advancement. They are often engaged in agricultural activities or in jobs in the informal sector, which tend to have lower labor productivity. Young women are much more likely than men to fall into this group, leading to a persistence
                    in the gender gap. Thus, the low employment rate of young women of Bangladesh is the result of several factors, including their roles as primary caregivers in households as well as societal norms that limit their participation in working
                    life.
                    <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Bangladesh is also experiencing additional challenges with high levels of informality and the need to transition these workers to formal employment which can help increase
                    protection as well as enhance revenue for governments to expand the provision of social protection measures and make investments in education and infrastructure.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup> However, Bangladesh
                    also faces the temptation to keep lower labour standards to remain competitive in a world economy that is propagating low wages and difficult working conditions.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Thus, the
                    marginalized youth community could not break through the cycle of poverty and remains beyond the reach of government initiatives of skill development or labour standard assurance mechanisms. As a result, SDG 8 which specifically calls
                    for the “full productive economic opportunities for young men and women” is challenging to implement in Bangladesh.
                </p>
                <h6>Understanding Possibilities for Economic Transformation</h6>
                <p>To fulfil the SDG 8 goal of full employment and decent work for all by 2030, how can developing countries and those furthest behind harness new technologies and opportunities to move people into more productive, better paid, and sustainable
                    jobs?
                    <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup> These was a major question raised at 73rd UN General Assembly.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Unfortunately, the world’s youth population is growing
                    sharply in regions with high poverty.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a></sup> According to the latest data of the International Labour Organization (ILO), in 2018, still nearly one in two workers of the Association
                    of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region was in vulnerable employment. Today, two out of three workers in this region are in informal employment. It is easy to understand the frustrations of young people in Bangladesh, because they
                    country is going through a paradigm shift resulting from technology. As a result, their jobs are radically shifting. In many Asian middle-income countries like India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri-lanka, Nepal, Myanmar, a high proportion
                    of young people are not in employment, education, or training. Neither working nor developing their productive skills for the future, this group represents a lost opportunity.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    Artificial intelligence, automation and outsourcing of digital work have created a lot of decent jobs already but there are a large number of people who will not be able to adapt to this new market and are bound to lose their jobs.
                </p>
                <p>Now the question regarding the future of work brings in more despair than hope for many young people because there remains the fundamental question of whether governments of Asia are prepared for changes brought on by the Fourth Industrial
                    Revolution. It is heartening to know that Bangladesh is the first Asia-Pacific country to commit to the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youths. Bangladesh pledged to train 250,000 youth
                    on digital skills and deliver 340,200 apprenticeships by 2023 through a2i project of Bangladesh government.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a></sup> The commitment by a2i is a good first step towards creating digital
                    jobs for youth. Yet is is unlikely that digital skills alone will take care of the unemployment problem. Although digital skills increases employability, these skills need to be reinforced with the knowledge in an individual’s specific
                    career area. </p>
                <p>The government of Bangladesh has started to invest in lifelong learning mechanisms in digital skills, entrepreneurship, strong apprenticeship programs, widespread technical and vocational education and Training (TVET). Bangladesh’s national
                    SDG progress tracker and sectoral strategies that expand decent jobs and addresses the vulnerabilities of the most disadvantaged people of the country are all steps in the right direction. The government has also established Technical
                    Training Institutes in most districts. This are some examples of the kinds of initiatives necessary to develop the employability of marginalized communities living in the interior parts of the country.</p>
                <p>The Bangladeshi government has made remarkable investments to increase employability of young people throughout the country and has provided opportunities for young people to transform themselves into human resources. Yet, many employers
                    do not seem to value skills acquired in existing TVET programs. Furthermore, the general basic education system that Bangladesh inherited from the British colonial period do not offer these skills effectively.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <h6>The Way Forward</h6>
                <p> Bangladesh has implemented a wide range of initiatives but focusing only on skills training will not be effective. The Bangladeshi government must alight skills development with aims of the country's educational institutions. Otherwise,
                    the program may not be more than a band-aid solution that does not end up benefiting marginalized youth. Equally important is the need for opportunities in the job market for applying these knowledge-based skills. This means there
                    must be adjustments made between job demand and job supply.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>One important recommendation is the need for social dialogue to develop effective policy responses that can help shape the future of work to achieve the best possible outcomes.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    Skills development, social protection, social dialogue, equal opportunity, occupational safety and health and adequate labour market regulations are essential components of the policy response to shape a future of work with sustainable
                    economic growth and decent work for all.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Furthermore, decent work for marginalized communities requires national and international actors to commit to the objective of creating
                    quality jobs globally and to pursue cooperative solutions to this challenge. This includes increased efforts to ensure the full and equal participation of women in the labour market. </p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>The latest labor force survey conducted in 2017 from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics shows that the number of employable people has increased at a higher rate than the number of jobs. Thus, more people are unemployed, including Bangladesh’s
                    most marginalized youth.Yet, training or apprenticeship opportunities alone cannot solve the unemployment problem. Skills development is only a part of the whole solution toward decent employment. Faced with the challenges including
                    an aging population, globalization, and digitalization, it is about time that countries all around the globe, including Bangladesh, put in place the mechanisms that will help workers to re-skill and find work and help employers to
                    create sustainable and decent jobs. Although there is much work to be done, Bangladesh is a frontrunner in achieving SDG goals With proper planning and resource mobilization, Bangladesh has a good chance of achieving SDG Goal 8 by
                    2030 and enable marginalized youth to have a decent work opportunities</p>
