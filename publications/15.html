                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution is often observed through the lens of fear and uncertainty. Recently coined by Charles Schwab of the World Economic Forum, this era is defined by the intersection of exponential technologies, rapid social transformation, and institutional shifts. When we hear about the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is often through the megaphone of a warning. We are warned to fear the pending the job losses, the economic disruption, and most of all the uncertainty of a world that is accelerating beyond our control. What if, instead, we looked at the Fourth Industrial Revolution as an opportunity for economic transformation? For the first time in history, we have the tools and systems to create an economy that works for all people. The rate of change facing public and private institutions could create the conditions for us to recalibrate our economies to work for the common good. </p>
                <p>In many of the world’s wealthiest economies, such as the U.S., the economic system is not working for most of the population. Inequality has been accepted as a condition of free market economies, and it has continued to accelerate within countries in recent decades. Naturally, this has correlated to a lack of mobility, especially for low-income youth. Increasingly, though, we have the tools and technologies to steer more equitable learning opportunities and employment outcomes. Whether we do so will determine whether we can muster the political will, the strategic systems perspective, and the policy innovation to leverage the resources at our disposal. </p>
                <h6>Challenges</h6>
                <p>One of the most urgent Sustainable Development Goals set out by the United Nations was focused on improving youth transitions by 2020. Target 8.6 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out an objective to substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) by 2020<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. According to the World Employment and Social Outlook report issued by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2019, this target “will almost certainly be missed.” Over one-fifth of youth around the world are still disconnected from the workforce, a reality which has not been substantially improved in any of the income groups<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Given the failure in achieving demonstrable progress on creating equitable opportunities for youth, it is clear that countries need a new paradigm for developing effective education to employment systems at the national level. This paper will therefore attempt to propose a national system that is better adapted to the systemic challenges that will affect youth education and employment between now and 2030.                     </p>
                <h6>Methodology</h6>
                <p>Through a comparative analysis, I have assessed the national education to employment systems of two countries that maintain among the lowest NEET rates in the world: Switzerland and Sweden. From there, I extrapolated key characteristics from those systems and cross-referenced them with existing research on policies for education to employment systems in the United States, a country that faces significant challenges in reducing NEET. Ultimately, this led to a set of recommendations for the United States to develop a national “education to employment system”. The objective of this system is to demonstrate a national strategy for implementing evidence-based recommendations vetted within the United Nations and put forward by the ILO Commission on the Future of Work. These recommendations include:</p>

                    <h6>Comparative Analysis</h6>
                    <p>Due to the complexity of the relationship between education to employment, national governments must take a systems approach in order to sustainably and effectively address the issue. This paper compares two national systems for creating a strong transition from education to employment: Switzerland and Sweden. See Table 1 for a summary of the contemporary analysis. </p>

                                Both countries have engineered a variety of interconnected policies and solutions to form a system that can provide an on-ramp into the economy for youth across varying regions, sectors, and socioeconomic conditions. Taking a systems approach is especially necessary when it comes to the policy challenge of reducing NEET. Navigating the transition from education to employment is more complex now than ever before.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                        <h6>United States </h6>
                            <p>At the national level, many of the challenges facing governments are so complex that they require a “system-of-systems perspective.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup> One of the primary reasons that Switzerland and Sweden have achieved strong outcomes for youth is that both countries have taken a systems approach to youth employment. This paper therefore aims to develop a framework for national-level solutions to reducing NEET, through a systems perspective. The rate of NEET in the United States is considerably higher than in Switzerland and Sweden at 13.7%, making it an ideal country for comparison. In order for the United States to leapfrog progress on NEET in time to counteract impending challenges, the country would need to consider the following questions: </p>

                            <p>A great deal of research has been carried out on how the U.S. can address specific aspects of youth employment, whether through expanding apprenticeships or developing systems to track labor market data. However, these initiatives are often recommended as standalone interventions, rather than solutions as part of a system. Below, I outline a systematic approach to achieving three outcomes in the United States. The intended outcomes are inspired from policy recommendations outlined by the ILO Commission on the Future of Work: </p>

                                                <li>• <u>Exchange data between public and private sector</u> - Data is one of the critical pieces for  employers to share current and future skills and jobs needs with government partners. (GBCE). This helps in building the appropriate pathways for economic development. Governments may need to incentive information sharing through public-private partnerships built around shared objectives on youth employment and economic growth.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup></li>
                                                <li>• <u>Streamline efforts into one common system or agency</u> - According to the Government Accountability Office, the U.S. spends $18 billion across 47 different programs, scattered across different agencies often with competing priorities. Federal efforts should be coordinated into a common effort focused on creating economic pathways for those most in need<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. This can either be done through the creation of a new government agency focused on transitions from education to employment or an interagency initiative focused on maximizing the benefits of shared resources. </li>
                                                <li>• <u>Make real time jobs data publicly </u> - Data is one of the most critical tools that a student needs to navigate their education in today’s labor market. In order to make informed decisions, students need access to information. Today, public labor market data in the United States is often outdated and fragmented, which prevents it from being used as a compass by students<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Still, in an economy where students are expected to take an active role in adapting their learning journey to the needs of the labor market, knowledge is power. Private companies such as Burning Glass Technologies currently have data systems to predict jobs forecasts with increasing accuracy, demonstrating that it is possible to assess data that informs pathways for governments, employers, students, and educators<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. However, the government must invest in developing its own public data capacity to inform decisions on education to employment pathways for all participants in the labor market. </li>

Apprenticeships in the U.S. were traditionally restricted to construction trades. This has presented employers with significant barriers to developing quality apprenticeships, ranging from outdated regulatory frameworks to lack of clarity around industry standards. The government should work more directly with industry coalitions of private sector leaders on joint funding and R&D to develop scalable frameworks for apprenticeships across occupations. One such coalition is the Workforce Partnerships Initiative, led by the Business Roundtable and supported by the Business and Higher Education Forum. This would address the three major barriers for U.S. employers to expand apprenticeships (startup, regulatory complexity, and lack of existing industry infrastructure) as outlined in a study carried out by the Aspen Institute Skills for America’s Future initiative.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a></sup> </li>

This is demonstrated by the Swedish approach of taking active measures for at-risk youth<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Another stopgap may include the Negative Income Tax (NIT) for youth under 25, which would prevent youth who are facing unemployment from facing the compounding conditions of unemployment.</li>

Although the federal government has invested modestly in expanded apprenticeships, investment in vocational training should expand in line with the quantifiable labor market needs for vocational training in the United States. The government should seek to chart a path towards increasing the budget for apprenticeships from $200m to $2b, without compromising quality standards of apprenticeships (outlined by the Pathway to Advance Youth Apprenticeships)<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"></a></sup> or syphoning funding from existing vocational programs.

Today, processing information is still costly and complex, but we have far more access to data about labor markets in real time. <br>Governments should connect the dots to leverage the power of data to allocate resources for education and training in a way that is both equitable and informed on the conditions facing sectors, geographies, and citizens in real time. The U.S. government should follow the Swedish approach to collecting data through a public employment system that benefits workers. By supporting youth in charting employment pathways and, when needed, funding training opportunities to prevent unemployment, Sweden incentivizes youth to share data and report outcomes. </li>
                                                                <li>• <u>Charting pathways from education to occupations.</u> One of the challenges facing higher education in the United States is that degree programs remain mostly disconnected from labor market demands. One of the key benefits of the Swiss apprenticeship system is that it has allowed the government to create sustainable systems for mapping pathways from education to employment across 230 occupations. The United States should leverage its investments in apprenticeships to develop the private partnerships and digital infrastructure necessary to map links between learning opportunities and employment outcomes. Once a robust system of data is collected, public employment platforms can deploy technologies such as artificial intelligence to predict longer-term job prospects and help individuals take control over their own learning journey from schooling to career and beyond. </li>

This gives us greater power to adapt to changing labor market conditions in real time. More importantly, it allows national governments to move from a “reactive” approach (often reacting to trends after it is too late through slow moving institutional processes) to a more adaptive stance (using new information and technology to adapt in real time. </li>

                                                        <p>The U.S. could boost GDP by 2.1% from lowering NEET rates of 20-24 year olds to match Germany, adding $405 billion to GDP<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. This would require the nation to implement systems to reduce NEET among 24 year olds by 4.5 percentage points from 15.3% to 10.8%<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Contrary to popular discourse, the United States can be more like Sweden, and it can be more like Switzerland By delivering on the recommendations on the education to employment system outlined above, the United States has an opportunity to add hundreds of billions of dollars to GDP while generating equal opportunity for all youth. Furthermore, the country can help create the framework for other nations around the world to replicate and scale equitable pathways to opportunity by 2030.
