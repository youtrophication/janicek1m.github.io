                    where labor market flexibility is promoted, and workers have the opportunity to prosper. After describing LITAs and highlighting the successes of similar initiatives, this policy brief issues a call to action for reforms that assist
                    young people and workers whilst supporting the 2030 Agenda.</p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>The future of work is rapidly evolving, with changes in the global economy fundamentally transforming working life. In the latter half of the 20th Century, workers in economically advanced countries could expect long-term job security,
                    to make a living in a fixed location, and relatively large investments by employers in their training and development. Today the 21st Century worker, and the youth of today who are preparing to enter the labor force, confront a strikingly
                    different environment.</p>

                <p>
                    This environment is one of job insecurity, isolation and uncertainty. Work is becoming increasingly uncertain, with a more dynamically efficient economy creating short-term and task-based employment, resulting in forecasts estimating workers will change
                    jobs over nine times during their careers<sup id="fnref:2">
                            <a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> and that one-in-nine employees within OECD countries are on temporary contracts working in the ‘gig economy’.<sup id="fnref:3">
                                <a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a>
                            </sup> Work is also becoming increasingly isolated – in OECD countries, one-in-seven workers are now self-employed<sup id="fnref:4">
                            <a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> with a continuing trend for modern workers to reside in dispersed locations rather than central office hubs. In addition, work is becoming increasingly insecure due to the erosion of collective bargaining rights and fall
                    in trade union membership. For example, trade union membership in Germany has fallen from 35% in 1985 to 17% in 2016, and despite some trade union membership increases in developing countries, this has not been universal.<sup id="fnref:5">
                            <a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>
                </p>
                <h6>The Challenges Facing the Youth of Today</h6>
                <p>The youth of today will experience increased competition for fewer jobs. This comes from aging populations participating in the labor market for longer as seen in Western Europe and Japan, or from fellow young people due to demographic
                    bulges e.g. Africa<sup id="fnref:6">
                            <a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>. Automation will also increase competition, with up to two thirds of developing world jobs being susceptible to replacement<sup id="fnref:7">
                                <a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a>
                            </sup> and over 50% of leading companies expecting that automation will lead to a reduction in their workforce by 2022<sup id="fnref:8">
                                    <a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a>
                                </sup>. Job competition is already high for young people due to youth unemployment residing comparatively high at 13% meaning, “…nearly 67 million young people…are actively searching for work but are unable to find a job”
                    <sup id="fnref:9">
                        <a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>.</p>
                <p>The youth of today will also experience reduced employer investment in training, with recent figures showing the percentage of workers receiving employer-sponsored training falling by 42% and those receiving on the job training falling
                    by 36%, in comparison to previous decades.<sup id="fnref:10">
                            <a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> A recent survey of 1,200 CEO’s also shows that whilst 74% planned to use artificial intelligence in the future – only 3% planned to increase investment in employee training.<sup id="fnref:11">
                                <a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a>
                            </sup></p>
                <p>The youth of today will also have to adapt to the accelerating pace of change. Previously, those with a higher level of education could expect a wage premium, yet “by 2020 the knowledge college students acquire will have an expected shelf
                    life of less than five years”.<sup id="fnref:12">
                            <a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> This trend will cause underemployment – where college graduates take jobs that do not require a degree. The increased speed of change, and shorter time of skill relevance in the labor market, also produces a greater threat
                    to those who are not in employment, education or training (NEET).</p>
                <p>Therefore, the education and skills one obtains when they are young can no longer last entire careers. The youth of today, will need to update their existing skills and acquire new ones constantly throughout their career, making the current
                    ‘education-job training-work-retirement’ model obsolete. If nothing changes, the consequences could be disastrous – with the effects of higher youth unemployment, low-quality work or automation displacement leading to individual despair,
                    an economic slowdown and social unrest.</p>
                <p>Instead, in order to thrive in the future, new policies and new models are necessary to provide young people with the opportunities for continual upskilling, retraining and education. By doing so, countries can accelerate towards achieving
                    the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – specifically SDGs 4.3, 4.4, 8.3, 8.5 and 8.6.<sup id="fnref:13">
                            <a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup></p>
                <h6>Lifelong Learning and Lifelong Individual Training Accounts</h6>
                <p>Increased promotion of lifelong learning, and the creation of Lifelong Individual Training Accounts (LITA’s) for every citizen, including young people entering the labor market, can provide the correct labor-market model to ensure future
                    prosperity.
                </p>
                <p>Lifelong learning encompasses formal and informal learning from early childhood to adulthood and it provides a pathway to inclusion in labor markets.<sup id="fnref:14">
                        <a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a>
                    </sup> The paradigm also has transformative potential due to it promoting continual improvement, making it the correct skill formation paradigm for the modern economy. Yet current lifelong learning programmes have limited participation,
                    those who need it the most do not participate, and they “…[are] not always perceived as being useful”<sup id="fnref:15">
                            <a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>.</p>
                <p>However, greater spending on labor market programmes and the implementation of LITA’s can help. LITA’s would be individual accounts that are available to all workers who are eligible to participate in the labor force, who could use them
                    at any time to pursue further educational and skills development. They would belong solely to the workers (meaning they are transferable across employment positions) and the enrolment course of choice would be at the discretion of
                    the worker – within a pedagogy defined by both national and local labor market needs and government quality assurance mechanisms - to improve employment outcomes and reduce the misappropriation of funds. </p>
                <p>Digital technologies can help broaden participation in training due to online platforms reducing barriers to participation such as cost, time and resource constraints. Personal development pathways and digital interfaces can be designed
                    to have individual personalisation, helping LITAs provide workers with a view of the positive consequences of their efforts. This can be especially beneficial if accompanied by skill recognition frameworks, created by the government
                    and the private sector, that provide targeted support for vulnerable groups. Accompanying these accounts, changes in social protection to allow for an entitled number of hours of training for every employee would be enshrined as a
                    legal right, to help workers take time to invest in their future<sup id="fnref:16">
                            <a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>.
                </p>
                <p>LITAs can be financed by higher public spending on labor market programmes, alongside businesses providing employee-training schemes and subsequently benefiting from training levies and tax incentives. The guaranteed monetary amount a
                    worker receives in their account, which is reviewed on an annual basis, would be based upon a regressive relationship on current and past earnings, alongside their social circumstances and regional location.</p>
                <h6>A Call to Action</h6>
                <p>The benefits of creating LITA’s include substantially improving flexibility within the labor market. This flexibility allows workers to transition quicker between jobs and to pursue a wider variety of career interests. These accounts also
                    help to improve the educational level of the workforce through the creation of strong incentives and improved opportunities – which generates a high rate of return for the worker, the private sector and the economy. Finally, through
                    being more flexible and more educated, workers are more likely to adapt to changing market conditions, reducing the likelihood of an increased burden on the welfare system.<sup id="fnref:17">
                            <a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup></p>
                <p>When implementing LITA’s one can draw on the lessons learned from other countries that have implemented lifelong learning initiatives. Singapore benefited from having a defined list of training providers and providing direct subsidies
                    to individuals, which helped over 285,000 Singaporeans receive training.<sup id="fnref:18">
                            <a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> The success of France’s le compte personnel de formation resulted in over 500,000 hours of training being accrued in 2016 with over 65% of those hours completed by job seekers – its key target audience.<sup id="fnref:19">
                            <a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup></p>
                <p>Yet the global leader in promoting lifelong learning is Denmark. Heavily influenced by the inauguration of højskoler (people's high schools) and the pioneering work of Niels Grundtvig (1783-1872) in the 19th Century, Denmark has created
                    a labor market where people can learn and develop the skills they need to thrive. It provides the highest percentage of GDP to labor market programmes within the OECD at 3.2% - Germany and the USA devote only 1.4% and 0.2% respectively
                    <sup id="fnref:20">
                            <a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote"></a>
                            </sup> - and this has created a highly qualified and flexible workforce that has prospered in the knowledge economy. </p>
                <p>The result has been transformational. Between 1995 and 2008, Denmark had an average unemployment rate of 4.9%, compared with 8.5% in the rest of the EU15 and a dramatic fall in its long-term unemployed – whilst providing “income security
                    for workers and economic freedom for employers”<sup id="fnref:21">
                            <a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>. The 2018 Global Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum ranks Denmark as the 10th most competitive in the world, largely due to its flexible labor market<sup id="fnref:22">
                                <a href="#fn:22" rel="footnote"></a>
                            </sup>. This shows what lifelong learning programmes can achieve, and whilst this model cannot be replicated easily, it should act as a call to action to other countries.</p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>Future economic and social success relies upon bold labor market programmes. Such programmes can prepare the youth of today to be agile, able to overcome increased labor competition and the rise of automation, resilient to an increased
                    pace of change, whilst possessing the self-motivation and discipline for continuing education and job training.
                </p>
                <p>The youth of today can do this through the support of the state, via the adoption of the principle of lifelong learning and labor market programmes such as LITAs. Alongside working with the private sector, and their own efforts, this change
                    can help young people thrive in new jobs aligned to the 2030 Agenda.</p>
                <p>As New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman states, for workers to achieve prosperity in the future, “you will have to be a lifelong learner.”<sup id="fnref:23">
                        <a href="#fn:23" rel="footnote"></a>
                    </sup> It is imperative that the future role of public policy, through labor market programmes, is to work with all stakeholders to ensure that such opportunities exist. The creation of Lifelong Individual Training Accounts is a good
                    place to start. </p>
