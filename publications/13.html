                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>With so much attention on millennials, a spotlight should shift towards another segment that can significantly influence economic growth and impact in the Future of Work - the aging population and workforce. As life expectancy and quality of life increases, retirement age remains static, and the population of elderly grows, a silver economy is emerging of which societies are not yet prepared to access today due to policy and technology shortfalls. Simultaneously, there is a (dis)inclusion. Social isolation and loneliness epidemic among elderly that results in lost of purpose, cognitive decline, and significantly healthcare risks and burden on society. The authors survey the state of policy and technology to address these issues and conclude that more needs to be done to create successful access channels and transfer the growing population into economic benefits and reduced risks and cost to society.</p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>Bob is the most socially plugged in volunteer on the author’s political campaign for Boston City Council. He communicates out via call, email, text, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. His stiff fingers make it so that he occasionally inserts a typo, but he does not let that slow him down and autocorrect technology helps. At 73 years old, Bob is one of the oldest volunteers and also one of the best. Two years ago, Bob was laid off from his job. He has tried valiantly to find another job, without any success. He has lengthy writer and editor experiences, but has had no success making it past the first interview.</p>
                <p>As life expectancy expands in countries with developed economies<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a></sup>, Bob is one of many seniors facing a particular challenge: they are capable and need employment but are not finding employers willing to hire them. According to an AARP study, 61% of respondents over the age of 45 reported experiencing age discrimination in the workplace<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Bob’s involvement in the campaign provides a direct value for her team and in return imbues Bob with purpose and community, which in turn helps reduce risks of cognitive decline and increase chances of longevity. Furthermore, thanks to the advent of technologies like Google Drive and video conferencing, he can be more mobile and work remotely when needed. As his search for paid employment continues, he can continue to volunteer to keep sharp and improve his prospects.This article presents a perspective on how policy and technology can better provide opportunities for a growing aging population to ensure economic growth, continued education, inclusion and reduced healthcare cost burden on society.</p>
                <h6>Growing Silver Economies</h6>
                <p>Today, 8.5 percent of people worldwide (617 million) are aged 65 and over. According to a new report, “An Aging World: 2015,” this percentage is projected to jump to nearly 17 percent of the world's population by 2050 (1.6 billion)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.We are just starting to grapple with the societal and economic impacts of this trend. How do we rethink societal norms and structures to accommodate and integrate our growing population of seniors? </p>
                <p>We can look to Japan for one example of how to better integrate the older population. Over 25% of Japan’s population is now over 65 and that number is expected to grow to 40% in the next 10 years<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. One of the country’s key focuses is the integration of the elderly into community via policies like Design for 100-Year Life Society, businesses rethinking to target older customers, and healthcare adopting elderly-friendly technologies<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Japan believes that all this can create a friendly environment with a strong, integrated aging community contributing to a growing economy and reduced healthcare costs.</p>
                <p>As one of the authors, Hélène, knock doors throughout Boston, she spends much of her day with the only people who are likely to answer the door at 2pm on weekdays, the elderly. Many of them invite the author into their homes for a visit. As much as these conversations are enjoyable, there is often a painful undertone of loneliness and boredom. Boston has an exceptionally high number of educational institutions. This means that there is a lot of elderly who have much to teach as well as who yearn for mental stimulation. The author met one elderly woman recently who had immigrated from Lebanon and got her PhD in computer technology - the first woman in her class to attain this degree. She longs for intellectual challenge and reads a novel a day, in addition to trade publications, in hopes of keeping her brain active.</p>
                <p>Research shows that people who are socially isolated experience cognitive decline and have poorer health outcomes<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. In addition, participants with a sense of purpose experience better health outcomes. “The stronger the participants felt they had a purpose in life, the lower their risk of dying. This result remained even when the scientists adjusted their calculations for factors that could affect their score, such as a participants' sociodemographic status and their health.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup> The lack of working policies, infrastructure or engagement with seniors presents a tremendous financial burden on society. From a healthcare cost standpoint, a recent report indicates that loneliness and social isolation leads to increased health risks among seniors<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup>, which could result in a heavy care burden on society. Our community, and the population at large, would benefit tremendously from the social and reintegration of our seniors. Extrapolation of current trends to call out several critical issues: 1) Social (dis)inclusion of the aging population, 2) Number of wasted work hours and economic potential, 3) Skill/knowledge/brain drain, 4) Resultant healthcare costs from mental deterioration or loss of ability, and 5) Retirement social security burden.</p>
                <p>Like the 73-year-old political campaign intern Bob, many of the elderly individuals the author met with have multiple communications devices, which means they could in fact tele-commute and do work remotely with some accommodations. What steps can we take to integrate our aging seniors into our communities and workforce?</p>
                <h6>Policy Recommendations for the Aging Population</h6>
                <p>A sustainable solution to this problem will require a collective effort across both effective policy making and technology implementation. We need to call on policymakers to incentivize organizations to integrate our seniors. As we rethink our working hours from an outdated 1960s nine-to-five structure to a more flexible approach, we can integrate people who need part-time or remote work. The gig economy provides an additional opportunity for seniors to pick up short-term work assignments. Many large companies have diversity and inclusion programming and training. These programs can be expanded to cover age discrimination and help people recognize the value of their older colleagues, rather than just writing them off. </p>

                <p>The US for example have outdated policies including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) from 1967 and recent interpretations of law including 2009 Supreme Court ruling in “Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.,” have made it more difficult to prove age discriminiation as compared to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. New efforts by influential law makers are under way including the The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (POWADA) but this is only scratching the surface of what needs to be done to address access and infrastructure needs of people like Bob.</p>
                <p>There should also be broad recognition and support for organizations working to bring seniors and younger generations together. In California, a nonprofit called Bridging the Gap pairs older Chinese immigrants with high school students in a double mentorship program. The young students learn culture and language from the older folks and the seniors get help with their technology from the youth. Both groups experience feelings of inclusion and purpose. Programs in Japan and Taiwan provide established channels for seniors to volunteer their time in public infrastructure such as hospitals to stay engaged.</p>
                <p>Technology must be the other driver that provides an accelerant for integrating seniors as part of the future of work and inclusion. It is commonplace today to meet seniors as drivers via Uber and Lyft or run errands on TaskRabbit as part of the gig economy. Airbnb’s fastest growing segment are senior homeowner hosts<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. However, these generalist technology platforms represent a small fraction of senior skillset and time conversion into the volunteer and work force. More technology platforms are needed to cater to senior-specific needs around access and must incentivize employers willing to take on unit contributions from this demographic. A search for senior-specific platforms in the US that can offer reliable sources of work came up with minimal solutions - an opportunity for entrepreneurs and investors.</p>
                <p>Finally, we should invest in tech and retraining to prepare our seniors for the modern workplace. Changing the workplace environment to become more senior friendly have also had increased activity. Seniors have needs around vision impairment, other disabilities and ergonomic that should be addressed in order to better utilize the aging workforce. An article in the MIT Technology Review on the topic indicated that fundamental shift in the design of the workplace must shift as “designers don’t always think about older people.”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Tech companies like Google and Amazon are thinking about the older population as customers and workers; Microsoft publishes an online “Guide for Individuals with Age-Related Impairments.”</p> 
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>According to the WHO, by 2050, the world’s population of people over the age of 60 will double.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a></sup> As life expectancy continues to increase and baby boomers move towards retirement, our aging population is a growing and critical segment and we should all be paying more attention. Reintegration of our seniors into the workplace has both societal and economic benefits. As  really move the needle economically for all segments of the population, not only those aging. Despite data points of progress in both technology and policy, the authors review of the landscape concluded that there needs to be significantly more investment, policy thinking, and rapid execution in these arenas to address growing concerns around the aging workforce and senior population. Even Japan with arguably the most sophisticated in senior access policy and infrastructure is only starting to fulfill the vast potential of the silver economy.</p>
                <p>Every day, when Bob shows up ready and eager to work, the author is remotivated to push for policies that would incentivize organizations to integrate folks like him into the workforce. How can we make sure that the areas covered in this article continue in the right direction as policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs moving forwards?</p>
