                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>Sub-Saharan Africa is confronted by a demographic structure that will see a large part of the population come of working age over the next few years. Providing decent work, especially to the youth, will be a challenge and governments are
                    looking for solutions to tackle the problem. There is increasing evidence that startup incubators boost employment creation. While the early stage incubation programs appear to be effective, there is still a gap when it comes to scaling
                    and deal flow. This paper argues incubators are a potential tool for employment creation but more importantly they also empower participants. For countries with a high youth unemployment rate, providing a positive outlook on the future
                    can be a core argument in favour of incubators. </p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>Developing countries in general, and those on the African continent in particular, are faced with a demographic structure where large numbers of the population will be of working age in the coming years<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a></sup>
                    <sup id="fnref:2">
                        <a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> and where there are few employment opportunities for younger generations entering the work force.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup> According to the International Labour Organization
                    (ILO), most of the Sub-Saharan African region is at risk, with more than 1 million individuals becoming unemployed in 2017; 72% of whom are working in vulnerable conditions.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>The lack of employment generally has the potential to cause social unrest, while the quality of existing jobs is a contributing factor to social discontent as work is an important trademark of human identity in today’s world.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a> </sup> The population structure however, can also provide for a significant demographic dividend.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup> The term demographic
                    dividend signifies a reduction of the youth dependency ratio in this context and results in positive effects in terms of “labour supply, savings and human capital”.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Sustainable development goal (SDG) 8 aims to promote “sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all”.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a></sup> As incubators
                    are one potential pathway for job creation, the focus of this paper links to the topic of “Youth Entrepreneurship & Self-Employment” as provided in the publication concept note.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup>
                    <sup id="fnref:11">
                        <a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup><sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <h6>Methods</h6>
                <p>This short paper is based on a literature review and connected to a report produced for the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a></sup> during a Master’s class entitled
                    “Practical Project in Development Cooperation” at the University of St. Gallen. The class required students to consult for the SDC and granted access to experts from the field to have in-depth discussions with them about the topic
                    of this short paper.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>

                <h6>Discussion</h6>
                <p>
                    In the last ten years, the topic of entrepreneurship has attracted attention worldwide. Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) and investors are now complementing more traditional actors in the field of development. Simultaneously there has been a surge of
                    incubator creation.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"></a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>No matter the environment, a large majority of startup companies (‘startups’) do not survive longer than two to three years.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Incubators are designed to support the startups in
                    the early stages of their lifecycle and can leverage the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector for better economic growth.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Incubators on the African continent have only
                    been established in recent years as a tool to enable enterprise creation and eventually reap the benefits in terms of job formation and salary disbursement.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Some of the key
                    metrics for the success of an incubator include whether the companies that complete the incubation program have more employees, better yield, and more sales.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote"></a></sup> In academic
                    literature there are varying definitions of what constitutes an incubator. The definition adopted for this paper is that of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), which describes an incubator as a “systematic way
                    to support the establishment and growth of a new company… that provides physical space and a number of services to start-ups, helping them through the earlier stages of their development”.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    This definition was chosen because it is simultaneously inclusive while identifying the main characteristics of an incubator.</p>
                <p>The Global Accelerator Learning Initiative (GALI) regularly publishes its latest findings on the effectiveness of incubators and has specific publications tailored for emerging markets.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    GALI shows that incubators in emerging countries produce increased revenue, create more jobs, and attract higher equity investments and higher rates of access to debt for startups.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    Therefore, there is some evidence that suggests that incubators could be a useful tool for job creation. </p>
                <p>For the region of Sub-Saharan Africa, the benefits of an incubator program match those of the emerging markets sample.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" rel="footnote"></a></sup> The key contribution according to the startups themselves
                    is access to direct funding, network and skill building.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>

                <p>One key issue for the sector is growth acceleration after the initial incubation phase. While incubators are a useful tool for the first phase of creating a company, there is a gap between that initial push and reaching the stage where
                    impact investors can confidently invest their funds.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Existing literature for the startup segment has plenty advice how to deal with the challenge of scaling a nascent business.
                    <sup id="fnref:26">
                        <a href="#fn:26" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> Unfortunately literature is lacking when it comes to scaling startups in developing countries.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>In their previous research the authors have found that the effects of an incubator program go beyond the standard key performance indicators. Notably, the main benefits reported by experts in the field and former participants was the empowerment
                    of the applicants and self-confidence building.</p>
                <p>Learning how to think like an entrepreneur can be a powerful instrument to counteract youth unemployment and a negative outlook on the future<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Innovative ideas can change whole sectors. Mpesa, a mobile phone-based money transfer and financing company, is one example of a disruptive business idea that has transformed the financial landscape of Kenya. Through such enterprises the
                    concept of mobile money has seen rapid scaling in Sub-Saharan Africa.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Incubator programs offer, prospective entrepreneurs the opportunity to learn how to deal with local market environments and regulatory processes, as well as how the informal business networks are structured. To enable this, it is crucial
                    to have local talent with the required experience to impart this knowledge to the founders. Incubators have the potential to generate substantial effects because the solutions are locally tailored.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>Incubators can be a possible solution in the toolkit to counteract youth unemployment. GALI presents promising data from emerging economies and Sub-Saharan Africa.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" rel="footnote"></a></sup> While the
                    early stage incubation programs appear to be effective, there is still a gap when it comes to the next stage of scaling and deal flow.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>The potential of incubators goes far beyond the standard key performance indicators such as job creation or equity investment. Rather the most significant benefit is the empowerment of participants. </p>
