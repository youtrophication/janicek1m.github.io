                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>The future of work has transformed greatly over the last decade. however, in hand with rapid technological advancement and globalisation comes the climate crisis, which is holding many back. The Pacific small island states are particularly
                    vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, natural disasters and environmental degradation. The increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters, rising sea levels, food insecurity, multiple health risks and possibility of
                    displacement pose existential threats to those living in small island Pacific states. This paper provides brief insights on the impacts of climate change and natural disasters in the context of the future of work, lack of disaggregated
                    data, gender gap, and current opportunities available that can be strengthened going forward by specifically honing in on challenges faced in small island Pacific states. Meaningful engagement and long-term investment in youth are
                    essential to building a resilient, sustainable and inclusive economy that promotes well-being and growth. We must work holistically to understand trends of employment and promote skill-building and decent work opportunities that will
                    shape the future of work for Pacific youth in the next decade.</p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>Climate change is controversial. Some deny it as a true phenomenon, but many communities feel the tangible effects of climate change. For the small island Pacific states, it is an everyday battle to survive in the face of the climate crisis.
                    The Pacific region has a youth population of over 50 percent and over the years, it has made strategic priorities linked to address issues affecting youth development, including Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) commitments and the
                    Pacific Youth Development Framework (PYDF) 2014 - 2023<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. The labour force participation rate of youth in the region is at an average of approximately 44%<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    while unemployment rates are around 14%, which is large considering the population size of most nations in the region. Providing employment in small, dispersed and isolated economies with high population growth and rapid urbanisation
                    is causing understandable concerns for many Pacific island countries. Implementation efforts have continuously been hindered for various reasons, a major factor being the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters and
                    environmental degradation in the region. Around the world, jobs that are prevalent today will suffer under the weight of climate change. Small island developing states (SIDS) are especially vulnerable due to their low capacity to adapt
                    <sup id="fnref:3">
                        <a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>. However, commitment to progress, the implementation of SDGs, and the youth development framework through a multi-sectoral and intersectional lens remains a priority for the Pacific region.</p>
                <p>The world of work has changed tremendously in the new millennium in parallel with changes to the environment, technology, global migration and growing inequalities<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Pacific island
                    countries are amongst the most exposed countries in the world to natural disasters and impacts of climate change. being small and geographically isolated only further exacerbates impacts. To put the extent of the damage into perspective,
                    Cyclone Winston in 2016 damaged 495 schools, 88 health facilities, disrupted access to basic services for weeks and cost the Fijian government FJD $2.85 billion<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup> (USD $1.3 billion),
                    approximately 20% of the annual GDP; similarly, Cyclone Pam in 2015 cost the Government of Vanuatu USD $449.4 million<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a></sup>, approximately 64% of the GDP of Vanuatu.</p>
                <p>Frequent natural disasters and deteriorating environmental conditions exacerbate economic and development challenges and pressure economic growth, which often leads to debts. To recover from the loss and damages of such natural disasters,
                    small island countries are left with no option but to take up loans to support the rebuilding process, pushing small island developing nations in the region further into debt. Reconstruction and recovery efforts add to public debt.
                    for example, in Vanuatu, the stock of public debt to GDP increased from 48.8% in 2016 to 53.9% in 2019<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup>, mainly due to disbursements for infrastructure and reconstruction activities
                    after Cyclone Pam.</p>
                <p>In addition to the immediate impacts of natural disasters, the slow-onset impacts of climate change are expected to affect:</p>

                        <li>Tourism revenue, which is also a large contributor to national GDPs </li>
                        <li>Migration trends, for example Pacific labour mobility schemes</li>
                        <li>Displacement, either temporary or permanent as impacts intensify</li>
                        <li>Security concerns, the displacement of communities has shown a rise in tensions, conflict and violence against women especially when host communities are struggling to make ends meet<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>The climate crisis requires immediate action and just and equitable transitions as we pave the way forward. The ILO guidelines for a just transition<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a></sup> are instrumental in providing
                    practical policy recommendations that can be adopted by nations as part of their adaptation strategies. The document proposes “<i>A just transition for all towards an environmentally sustainable economy, needs to be well managed and contribute to the goals of decent work for all, social inclusion and the eradication of poverty</i>”(p.4).
                    A transition that incorporates justice for workers and those affected by climate might be our only way forward. </p>
                <h6>Pacific Youth</h6>
                <p>Youth stakeholders recognise that a change to the way the region addresses youth is urgently required. The urgency of action was brought to attention through the <i>State of the Pacific Youth 2011: Opportunities and Obstacles<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup></i>                    report. The 2011 report highlighted underlying issues of poverty, rapid population growth, stagnating or underperforming economies, unemployment, political volatility, education systems and rising inequalities as causes of problems
                    for youth. The evidence from that report pointed towards majorly investing in the (i) governance of youth initiatives, (ii) data collection and analysis, and (iii) mobilising resources for youth. The findings helped shape the Pacific
                    Youth Development Framework, which brought together a coordinated approach to guide Pacific governments in ensuring transformative change for youth. The framework was created to support countries in developing their own youth policies
                    and addressing national implementation priorities. </p>
                <p>The PYDF highlights outcomes and focus areas that can be viewed in Figure 1 below:</p>
                <p><b><i>Figure 1: Development Outcomes for Youth.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a></sup></i></b></p>
                <center><img src="..\images\barkha-figure1.png" width=600px></center>
                <p>As in most places of the world, not all young people from the Pacific are the same. situations differ on the basis of geographical location, gender, sexual orientation, access to education, health care, social welfare and socio-economic
                    backgrounds. This by no means implies that no progress has been made. In Fiji, for example, the opportunities available for an 18 year-old in Suva will not be the same as those available to an 18 year-old from the outer islands. However,
                    the government has changed policies to push for nationwide change by making education free for all students until high school and providing bus fares and textbooks, as well as offering various mechanisms to support tertiary, vocational
                    and trade studies upon completion of high school. Strategic, targeted and youth-centred approaches are necessary for widespread change. </p>
                <p>Currently, there are major gaps in the availability of disaggregated data on young people in the Pacific. Improved statistical data and analysis on youth is critical to identify gaps and provide evidence to guide investments. Many Pacific
                    Island countries and territories (PICTs) do not measure youth unemployment with international standards. Thus, there is a need to think about sustainable solutions that incentivise youth populations and takes into account their skill
                    levels.
                </p>
                <h6>Pacific Labour Mobility </h6>
                <p>With the introduction of seasonal worker schemes in Australia and New Zealand, the Pacific islands have benefitted through increased incomes, asset growth, improved standards of living, and educational support of family members, as well
                    as overall economic benefits to the individual, family and community<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. New Zealand established the Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme (RSE) in 2007 with the twofold objective
                    of addressing labour shortages in the horticulture and viticulture sectors in New Zealand and supporting the economic development of Pacific islands via remittances sent home.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Similarly, Australia’s seasonal worker program brings workers, who are tied to an employer or labour-hire company, from nine Pacific countries to work in the horticulture industry. Traditionally, the horticulture industry relied on backpackers
                    to fill the labour gap. however, Pacific islanders have been identified to stay up to six times longer and are on average 20 percent more productive on farms<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. The scheme
                    has seen seasonal workers use the money earned in Australia to support the development of their families back home; for example, using money earned to support childrens’ education, build houses, or start businesses. Post Cyclone Pam,
                    there was an increase in applications from Vanuatu to enter Australia and New Zealand under seasonal worker schemes.the New Zealand government responded by making concessions for existing workers and waiving the visa fees for RSE workers
                    <sup id="fnref:15">
                        <a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>. The cast majority of ni-Vanuatu workers decided to stay after the cyclone, as it was clear that ongoing remittances were critical not only in the short-term but also as part of a longer term strategy
                    to rebuild, respond and recover from natural disasters<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</p>
                <p>In 2018 alone, New Zealand supported 12,850<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"></a></sup> RSE workers. Similarly, since its establishment in 2012, Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) has supported over 33,000<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    seasonal jobs for workers from the Pacific and Timor-Leste. The success of the SWP in contributing to the economic development of Pacific island countries while addressing labor shortages in Australia paved way for the Pacific Labour
                    Scheme which commenced in July 2018 and enables citizens from Pacific countries to take up opportunities in Australia for up to three years<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Although considered a success
                    in many aspects for Pacific island workers, the scheme is not a perfect one and there are still some very important issues that need to be addressed. For instance, exploitation<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote"></a></sup>,
                    hazardous working conditions, restrictions on joining unions<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote"></a></sup>, poor living conditions<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" rel="footnote"></a></sup>, death while on the scheme,
                    underpaid staff, low numbers of women and understanding the social and cultural implications of moving away from home and communities are all areas where concerns need improvement. Active efforts are being made to figure out the best
                    way for Pacific workers and Australia’s and New Zealand’s governments to continue strengthening their partnerships and providing options for labour mobility. Overall, there is consensus that the positives outweigh the negatives in
                    the labour mobility schemes and challenges can be addressed through existing mechanisms.</p>
                <h6>Gender Dimensions</h6>
                <p>In unfortunate accordance with global trends, Pacific gender norms are no different. the gender gap manifests itself in not just pay but also in rates of unemployment. The ILO has noted that women and young people in agriculture and tourism
                    are more likely to be drastically affected by climate change than men - women tend to be poorer and disproportionately represented in both sectors. Women are also more likely to be victims of sexual and gender based violence after
                    disasters strike with limited access to health and support services<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</p>
                <p>Additionally, while both women and young people are heavily employed in the informal economy and more likely to undertake precarious work<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Young women particularly face high
                    levels of unemployment and are burdened with sexual and gender based violence and discrimination<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Even in the case of the SWP, female workers in Australia with a higher mean
                    level of education were earning slightly less than the men, but were remitting more<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. However, steady progress has been noted in this regard the Pacific islands governments
                    have committed to a Gender Equality Declaration<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" rel="footnote"></a></sup> to prioritise equal and meaningful representation of women in decision-making as well as launched the <u>Pacific Partnership to End Violence against Women and Girls</u>                    in the region. These agreements, which are similar to the PYDF, are meant to guide and complement existing efforts of national governments.</p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>As we continue to envision the future of work, we have to be realistic in envisioning what this means regionally and nationally. It is no longer just a youth issue, a climate change issue, or a decent work issue, it is all of that and
                    so much more. The need to address these challenges simultaneously and respectfully is crucial for all; however, the urgency is higher for some regions than others. Pacific youth are no different but very different at the same time,
                    it is our diversity that strengthens us and keeps us resilient. A just and equitable transition that take into account injustices and incorporates learnings from the labour and climate movements is imperative going forward meaningfully.</p>
                <p>Investment is needed to sustain agriculture, tourism, and fishery sectors with infrastructure development and knowledge building efforts. Efforts must be made to promote gender equity and formal employment opportunities for youth. Research
                    with longer timeframes are needed to fully comprehend the transformative and negative impacts on Pacific youth in relation to the “future of work” initiatives. Periodic mapping, baseline and disaggregated data is crucial in identifying
                    gaps, tracking progress and making relevant change where needed. An evidence-based approach must be employed with clear support mechanisms nationally and efforts to seek academic and economic opportunities abroad must be planned for.
                    In order for us to create enabling environments for young people to grow sustainably and stay connected digitally, an intersectional, multi-sectoral approach is critical.We can no longer work in silos. We need a human-rights focused,
                    youth-centred agenda for the future of work that does not leave anyone behind.</p>
