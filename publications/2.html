                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>This paper argues that education-to-employment transition efforts are insufficient without a lesson on the “unwritten rules” of the workplace—and that the need for such a lesson is becoming ever more urgent as automation compels humans
                    to focus on what only humans can do: communicate, collaborate, and problem solve. This paper also includes a brief discussion of the most salient “unwritten rules” that ought to be prioritized in classrooms.</p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>The “21st century skills” of professionalism, communication, problem solving, and teamwork are the four most essential “career readiness” competencies for new college graduates to have when entering the workforce, according to the National
                    Association of Colleges and Employers’ 2018 survey of 201 employers.
                    <sup id="fnref:1">
                            <a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> Despite ~98% of employers declaring the competencies as “essential,” however, only ~54% of employers consider new graduates to be “proficient” in these competencies. The ramifications of this alarming
                    gap between expectations and reality should worry educators, students, and business leaders alike. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, Center for Education and Workforce, “Businesses large and small constantly tell
                    us how hard it is to find qualified workers who can not only do the job, but who can also show up to work on time, dress appropriately, and work well with a team. With almost 6 million unfilled jobs in America, this lack of soft skills
                    hurts workers, businesses, and the economy.”
                    <sup id="fnref:2">
                        <a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> Moreover, as more repetitive, predictable tasks become automated in our increasingly knowledge-based economy,
                    <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup> the need for a workforce that is well-equipped in uniquely human skills will become ever more urgent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite the general consensus on the importance of soft skills, employers and schools still lack a common language with which to define these soft skills.
                    <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup>
                    <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup> What does professionalism look like and sound like? What does it mean to be a problem solver? What are the ingredients of effective communication? Telling new workers to “show
                    attention to detail,” “take ownership,” and “manage up” is no different from telling a first-time cook nothing but “pick good ingredients” and “watch the time.” Abstractions only make sense for those who have had the lived experience.
                    For those who have not had the experience, abstractions can be frustrating, if not outright demoralizing. Students need prescriptive guidance—and prescriptive guidance require a common and precise language between employers, schools,
                    and students. Without properly translating for students what employers expect them to know and practice day-to-day at work, schools and employers will continue lacking an ability to upskill workers in an efficient, effective, and scalable
                    manner, supervisors will continue lamenting over the deficiencies of new graduates, and new graduates will continue scratching their heads about what they might be missing.
                </p>
                <h6>Defining a Hard-to-Define Concept</h6>
                <p>In response to the widespread and urgent call for a career-ready workforce, I interviewed 468 supervisors, interns, recent graduates, and human resources professionals across a range of industries, functions, and geographies to understand
                    the precise mindsets and tactics separating the most successful workers from the mediocre ones. For supervisors and human resource professionals, I asked two principal questions: (1) “What are the most common mistakes new graduates
                    and interns make in their first jobs?” and (2) “What separates the outstanding workers from the mediocre ones?” For interns and recent graduates, I asked, “Which specific workplace situations did you have to navigate through trial
                    and error that you wish you could have been explicitly taught in school?”
                </p>
                <p>The reflections from supervisors and subordinates alike pointed to a clear and consistent pattern: the most successful workers are not those who confine themselves to the <i>written rules</i> of the workplace; they are, instead, the ones
                    who identify and adapt to the <i>unwritten rules.</i></p>
                <p>It is unwritten, for example, that promotions are not solely based on hard work. They are also based on one’s ability to fit in, manage expectations, and build relationships. The <i>written rule</i> is that no question at work is a “stupid
                    question.” The <i>unwritten rule</i> is that workers are expected to give their supervisors solutions and not simply problems. Mediocre workers, for example, will often throw their hands up at the first sign of an obstacle and ask
                    for help. Stellar workers, on the other hand, will (a) <i>do their homework and then show their homework</i> and (b) <i>ask for feedback, rather than an answer</i>: first, they attempt to solve a given problem on their own and document
                    the struggles the encounter; next, they bundle multiple questions together and wait for the least disruptive time to consult a coworker; finally, they describe what they attempted on their own and then ask for others’ feedback. Though
                    seemingly subtle, the difference between saying, “How do I do this?” and “I am trying to accomplish X; I attempted A and B, but am struggling with C; can you offer me feedback on what I am doing wrong?” is the difference between looking
                    lazy or incompetent and convincing others that one has resourcefully exhausted all options before seeking assistance. With respect to communication, note the difference between saying, “I will be out of the office tomorrow” (or not
                    offering advance notice at all) and saying, “I am trying to schedule a check-up with my doctor in the coming weeks; I understand we have a major deadline this week, so I am looking at next Wednesday; I do not see anything on the team
                    calendar then; would it be okay if I took Wednesday off, or would you suggest a different time?” The former approach can come across as selfish, uncompromising, and uncaring. The latter approach, on the other hand, is likely to come
                    across as more proactive, organized, and considerate. With respect to professionalism, the difference between a worker who shows up to meetings with a notebook and pen in hand and a worker who shows up empty-handed (or, worse, with
                    their lunch) is the difference between a worker who looks dedicated and responsible and a worker who looks disorganized and disengaged.
                </p>
                <p>Of the 20 workplace situations I identified in my research where the <i>unwritten rules</i> ought to be taught more explicitly—and where training is likely to result in material operational efficiency gains—the most salient are the scenarios
                    of (1) navigating one’s first day, (2) receiving directions, and (3) delivering bad news. My research suggests that a worker who fails to make a positive first impression by failing to show up on time, dress in appropriate attire,
                    and ask the right questions is a worker who must work doubly hard to re-establish their reputation. Similarly, a worker who fails to ask the questions of (1) “<i>What</i> do I need to do?” (2) “<i>By when</i> do I need to do it?” and
                    (3) “<i>How</i> should I do it?” when delegated a task is a worker who will inevitably misinterpret a supervisor’s needs and waste valuable time doing the wrong work. Lastly, a worker who fails to give deliver bad news early and deliver
                    a plan for how they will solve the problem at hand and prevent similar problems from happening in the future is a worker who is unlikely to be trusted with important tasks again. Though perhaps obvious in retrospect, these <i>unwritten rules</i>                    are currently only taught through painful trial and error that puts both workers’ careers and firms’ bottom lines at risk.
                </p>
                <h6><i>Navigational Smarts</i> over <i>Book smarts</i></h6>
                <p>The principal finding of my research is that the difference between outstanding workers and mediocre ones is not <i>book smarts</i>, but rather <i>navigational smarts</i>. Whereas <i>book smarts</i> are a function of one’s academic aptitude
                    and training, <i>navigational
                    smarts</i> are a function of one’s ability to navigate the unwritten expectations of work and social situations—and to remain above those unwritten expectations. In the case of asking for help, the expectation is that workers will
                    save their supervisors time and stress—and not simply toss problems back to their supervisors to solve. In the case of taking time off, the expectation in a team environment is that individuals will act predictably and consider how
                    one’s actions or inaction will adversely impact other team members. Any action or inaction that surprises others adversely can be seen as inconsiderate. In the case of attending meetings, the expectation is that all attendees will
                    be engaged. As such, actions such as pulling out one’s phone, looking flustered when asked a question, and/or showing up empty-handed risk being interpreted as disengagement or, worse, incompetence.</p>

                <p>Figure 1. The “Range of Usefulness,” a framework uncovered through my research that encapsulates many of the <i>unwritten rules</i> of the workplace.</p>

                <p>Remaining above expectations is only half the battle, however. Not overshooting expectations—and, as a result, coming across as trying too hard—can be equally important. In other words, succeeding in the workplace comes down to remaining
                    within a certain “Range of Usefulness” (Figure 1), a figurative region between <i>good enough</i> and <i>outstanding</i>. To fall below <i>good enough</i> (to the <i>too little</i> zone) is to make careless mistakes, not follow instructions,
                    complete only part of a task, and/or miss deadlines. To overshoot <i>outstanding</i> (to the <i>too much</i> zone) is to make simple tasks complicated, do others’ jobs, make others look bad, and/or prioritize tasks that do not matter.
                    Immediately asking for help without first making an independent attempt is to do <i>too little</i>. Putting one’s head down and making unilateral decisions on matters where others expect to be consulted is to do <i>too much</i>. Failing
                    to alert others of one’s absence is to do <i>too
                    little</i>. Constantly pushing back on tasks because of one’s upcoming vacation is to do <i>too much</i>. Showing up late, empty handed, and/or without having read the meeting agenda is to do <i>too little</i>. Interrupting others
                    and/or correcting others in front of stakeholders others seek to impress is to do <i>too much</i>.
                </p>
                <p>Beyond being unfamiliar to new graduates, the <i>unwritten rules</i> of the workplace also contradict many of the habits that students develop in school. In school, the instructions are clear, the rubric is objective, and the quality of
                    one’s work is the only relevant input for the purposes of grading. As a result, whereas in school a student who starts and finishes a major project the night before a deadline may still earn an “A,” at work that same student may be
                    fired for failing to adequately manage stakeholders and expectations. Without explicitly teaching the <i>unwritten rules</i> of the workplace, either as a capstone experience in college or as part of new hire training at work, students
                    risk importing the same <i>book smart</i> habits from school and neglecting the <i>navigational smarts</i> that separate outstanding workers from the mediocre ones.</p>
                <p>Writing down and explicitly teaching the <i>unwritten rules</i> is neither about fueling a culture of conformity, nor is it about endorsing existing power structures of the working world, as inequitable as they may be. A curriculum on
                    the <i>unwritten
                    rules</i> is about navigating the world of work that <i>exists</i>. It is in no way meant to discredit or supplant efforts to design the more tolerant, inclusive, and forgiving world of work that <i>ought to exist</i>.</p>
                <p>The benefits of teaching the <i>unwritten rules</i> accrue to more than simply workers. Schools also have an opportunity to brand themselves as cultivating more “career-ready” graduates, while employers have an opportunity to build teams
                    that can reach full productivity more quickly.
                </p>

                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>The results of my qualitative research challenge the belief that “employability is an extremely complex, and somewhat vague, concept that is both difficult to articulate and define.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote "></a></sup> Employability is only vague if we settle for the broad notions of “professionalism,” “communication,” “problem solving,” and “teamwork.” It is not vague if we insist on a more granular definition in the form of specific situation-specific
                    behaviors. A mere twenty categories meaningfully captures the majority of common workplace situations—all of which can, in fact, be taught. A common language exists. A future where new graduates enter the workforce ready to hit the
                    ground running—and where humans are equipped with the 21st century skills to succeed in the future of work—is within reach. Schools and employers merely need to invest in training.
