                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>The future of work has never been more uncertain. Forces spanning automation to climate change will impact the livelihoods of billions of people worldwide. Yet when we only discuss this problem at the level of millions or billions we miss
                    the human centered reality of what it means to be an individual worker. Looking at the problems workers face through the lens of the learning sciences enables us to understand the landscape at an “n of 1;” through this lens it is evident
                    that traditional workforce development efforts that focus on reskilling in the latest tech content are outdated, and often become redundant soon after the learner has left the classroom. By shifting our focus from content delivery
                    to transformative learning experiences we can create a new paradigme. Core learning science concepts like exploration before explanation, moments of mastery, and situating learning in authentic contexts support workers in developing
                    the mindsets they need to navigate an ambiguous future. This reframe could be the difference between marginalized and vulnerable young people around the world being trapped in an endless cycle of reskilling and displacement, vs. becoming
                    workers that can act as agents in the world of work.</p>
                <h6>Discussion</h6>
                <p>Kyle, a recent high school graduate, went to Seattle’s 100,000 Opportunities job fair to find a job he needed an income to support his family. Kyle said he was finding it difficult to find a job because he had “no skills.” As we talked,
                    I learned how the automation of farm machinery had disrupted his last job and that he considered this previous experience irrelevant to the customer service positions on offer at the job fair. To overcome this hurdle, Kyle felt that
                    the only avenue open to him was to enroll in a reskilling program focused on retail-specific skills. </p>
                <p>Fast forward four years, and Kyle has been employed at a nationwide retail company, one that is looking seriously and has been making strides in workforce automation. Which is not surprising, given that the retail sector has contracted
                    by thousands of jobs due to the impact of automation and online shopping. Kyle is likely to face a similar fate again: job disrupted, feeling as though he lacks all relevant skills, and looking to reskilling as the only option for
                    him to move forward. But is it? We propose that we need to rethink our approach to workforce development, and found it in the core tenants of the learning sciences, human centered design, and the realities of the future of work. </p>
                <p>Kyle’s story is a common one these days, because the world of work is experiencing dramatic changes. Most attention is focused on increases in automation and growth in the capabilities of artificial intelligence, thanks to sensational
                    headlines and the grim predictions of researchers and futurists. And these concerns are definitely not misplaced. In the ASEAN-5, the five largest economies in Asia, over the next two decades 56 percent of jobs are at risk of being
                    automated away.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a></sup> In the United States estimates show that 47 percent of workers are at risk of being displaced by automation.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    </p>
                <p>According to the World Bank, a full two thirds of jobs in the developing world are at risk of replacement through automation.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup> And even if your job is not fully automated,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    it is likely to change dramatically. A 2016 OECD report estimated that 50-70 percent of jobs in member countries will have much of their tasks automated, and efficiencies created by task automation are likely to result in an overall
                    reduction of the labor force in affected jobs.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, automation and artificial intelligence are far from the only forces reshaping the world of work. Environmental upheaval inevitably affects work and workers. To take one dramatic example from beyond automation, factors like
                    climate change and overfishing will have significant deleterious effects on marine fisheries in the next 50 years.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup> This essential global resource supports the employment of
                    an estimated 260 million people worldwide,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a></sup> and the livelihoods of an estimated 660 to 820 million,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup> and these jobs
                    and livelihoods will be put at ever increasing risk.</p>
                <p>The question of how to prepare the current and future workforce for this uncertain landscape can seem intractable in the face of numbers of this magnitude and global scale. Workers caught in the shifting tides of the modern workforce can
                    feel robbed of their agency, and policy that protects their rights and empowers their choices is essential. But not all necessary changes can happen at the level of billions. Agency is made up of more than just the forces that act
                    upon an individual — their own skills, knowledge, and orientation towards the world forms a complementary piece of their ability to act as an agent within their world. </p>
                <p>Through the lens of the learning sciences we can approach these shifts in the world of work not just from a wide aperture of masses of displaced and disrupted workers, but from the perspective of individuals. We can approach it from the
                    point of view of the Kyle’s of the world. It can be much more manageable to face a problem of individuals than of masses, even billions of individuals. Moreover, if we cannot move the needle for the individual it seems unlikely we
                    can move it for the masses.</p>
                <p>There already exist many programs around the world tasked with reskilling disrupted and vulnerable workers. But current models leave much to be desired. Traditional workforce development programs usually take the form of reskilling programs
                    like the tech boot-camps that have sprung up around the United States. Not only can these programs be ineffective at increasing worker hirability and compensation in the short term,<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup>                    but especially in the case of coding boot-camps they train workers in skills likely to be vulnerable to automation within the next five years.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a></sup> And given that reskilling programs
                    aim to upskill workers into the hottest, or just the most available, jobs of the day the courses will also always trail the job market.</p>
                <p>So what is the answer? We have to stop preparing workers for just the jobs of the present or the future. We have to start preparing them for the jobs landscape of the present and the future. Navigating that landscape will require workers
                    to be adaptive and adaptable. In the terms of the learning sciences, workers will need both self-efficacy and a growth mindset.</p>
                <p>Self-efficacy, a key component of the larger concept of agency, is the difference between trying and not trying. It influences what problems people choose to take on, how much effort they put towards solving those problems, and their resilience
                    to adversity and failure.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup> As Albert Bandura, who coined the term, puts it “[i]f people believe they have no power to produce results, they will not attempt to make things
                    happen.”
                    <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a></sup> The volatile nature of the future of work means that workers must be prepared to attempt to make things happen.</p>
                <p>A related concept, growth mindset is the belief in the malleability of one's intelligence, abilities, and personality. Its corollary is fixed mindset, and the difference between the two mindsets has powerful impacts on how people approach
                    opportunities for learning and improvement. Those with a fixed mindset spend time and effort proving their intelligence and capability, and avoiding situations which challenge them or threaten failure. Those with a growth mindset seek
                    out opportunities for self improvement.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Given the rapid shifts in the world of work, a willingness to learn and grow is also essential.</p>
                <p>How do we get there? Through pedagogy. Both of these qualities can be inculcated in people, but are ill-served by curricula that focus on content at the cost of all else. A curriculum that encourages development of self-efficacy, for example,
                    can be built around any subject matter — so long as it is built to create moments where learners can experience mastery of tough and varied tasks, see such accomplishment modeled by their peers and others, receive encouragement, and
                    feel comfortable as they challenge themselves.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a></sup> A curriculum and pedagogical style designed just to deliver content as quickly as possible does not afford these key transformative
                    moments.
                </p>
                <p>Shifting the pedagogical approaches of workforce development programs is not impossible. Decades of research in the learning sciences have given us key principles that can be built into curricula and adopted by facilitators and teachers.
                    Allowing learners to explore a space or task before explaining it to them lets them engage in the essential act of sense-making, constructing for themselves the relationships between aspects of the physical, social, and symbolic worlds
                    they occupy. Understanding that learning is an activity embedded in contexts, environments, and people requires a curriculum developer or instructor to think not just about the surface level of content, but think critically about the
                    design of learning spaces and learning experiences.</p>
                <p>According to the OECD, young people (ages 16-25) from vulnerable populations will be most affected by automation in its member countries.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a></sup> And the issues of the future will be,
                    by their very nature, the issues of the youngest members of the population. This makes it essential to include young people in conversations about the future of work. One could imagine parliamentary task forces made up of equal numbers
                    of younger and older parliamentarians, or think tanks dedicated to the question of the future of work staffed by young scientists and thought leaders. Unfortunately, this is not the picture of the world today. </p>
                <p>In 2016, in national parliaments globally, only 1.9 percent of MPs were under 30, and that number only rose to 14.2 percent for those under 40.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"></a></sup> And yet, young people will be
                    both the hardest hit by workforce automation and living in the future of work for the longest. </p>
                <p>Excluding young people from the conversations means that we lose the voice of the future of workers in conversations about the future of work. It also means that we rob young people of the opportunity to develop their self-efficacy through
                    seeing models in powerful positions in policy and research. </p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>Wrestling with what it means to have meaningful or decent work has always been a difficult philosophical endeavor. Marx’s complex and historical theories of alienated labor feel very relevant facing the uncertainties of the future of work.
                    Just like in the era that Marx first wrote, the development of worker agency plays a critical role in the difference between an inclusive or exclusive future. And this sense of agency needs to be enabled in young people, so that they
                    have an opportunity to design the future of their own lives and work. </p>
                <p>So as we move into an increasingly uncertain and ever changing future of work, we call educators, policy makers, business people, and more to consider these questions:</p>
