                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>Labour market interventions are essential to shape a future of decent work and economic growth that leaves no one behind. Particularly in Latin America, a region that presents a landscape of lower productivity economic sectors and high
                    dependance on commodities. While striving into higher technology conversion is one of the main aims for economic growth, there are important risks of displacement and exclusion of large population sectors, specially women. The current
                    employment segmentation in the region already presents important limitations for women, particularly the poor and indigenous, which would be accentuated if gender dimensions are not at the center of labour market interventions moving
                    forward.
                </p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>Regardless of the various industrialization efforts in Latin America, the region still faces a strong dependance on commodities and its main production structure is based in low value creation chains of manufacturing, agriculture and natural
                    resource extraction. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>The later has particular effects in shaping labour markets, the access to decent jobs and creating opportunities to lift people out of poverty, particularly for women. Data shows that, from the 49% of women in Latin America that are considered
                    part of the labour force, 21,9% are concentrated in informal commercial activities, 11,5% in manufacturing, and 27,7% in paid care and domestic work; which is related to partial employment and lower income levels.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>In addition to minimum diversification and low productivity, the fall of purchasing power and the scarcity of secure living wages in the region has increased unpaid domestic and care work as survival strategies within households. The burden
                    of increased unpaid domestic and care work translates into structural obstacles of time use for women to enter the labour force. Recent data confirms that 43,4% of women in Latin America report family reasons as the main motive to
                    not actively look or engage in paid work. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Some of these challenges can be addressed through conversion into higher technology production structures as a means for economic growth and overcoming dependency on commodities. Nonetheless, in order to engage in efficient labour market
                    interventions that leave no one behind, the needs of women, particularly the poor, rural and indigenous, must be in the center of policy design and implementation.</p>
                <h6>Discussion</h6>
                <p>Data from 2014 shows that Latin American women work between 60 and 90 hours a week depending on the country, combining paid and non paid work, while the range for men is between 48 to 73.5 hours.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>As the role of women has expanded into being professionals and providers of income for their families, male roles have maintained over time with men rarely engaging in unpaid care and domestic work. According to data provided by UN Women,
                    41% of global working hours are compromised by unpaid domestic and care work, from which, 31% is done by women and only 10% by men.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Adding to the time constraints that this represents for women, the sexual division of labour within households has translated into employment segmentation associated with lower income and job insecurity. In Latin America 21,9% of employed
                    women are concentrated in informal commercial activities, while 27,7% take part in paid care and domestic work services.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Segmentation is also observed in employment productivity level, 51,8% of women in the region are employed in lower productivity sectors, and from that percentage, 82,2% of women do not have access to social security or a pension scheme
                    for their retirement<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup>, which highlights the degree of informality and job insecurity.</p>
                <p>When the participation of women in the labour force responds to economic stagnation and inequalities it does not serve to enhance their lives, but rather to increase overall workload, as men, the State and the private sector are not engaging
                    in redistributing unpaid social reproduction work. </p>
                <p>Evidence confirms that there is a direct relationship between domestic and care work overload with the type of jobs that women have access to. Most segmentation in employment sectors answers to the need of women to reconcile care and paid
                    labour in flexible schedules, informality and auto-employment strategies.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>The relationship between paid and unpaid work strongly exhibits a simultaneous inclusion/exclusion of women in the labor force, while integrating them under employment insecurity schemes, they are being excluded from economic and social
                    mobility opportunities<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>. Additionally, State subsidiary welfare programs and cash transfers might keep these marginalized populations under the radar, but they don’t redistribute
                care and domestic work nor represent a path out of poverty<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</p>
                <p>Development research has shown that cash transfers, conditional or unconditional, even if they are part of a scheme of social security networks, need to be framed in a broader structural agenda that addresses labour market mobility and
                    social networks to achieve long term results<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, while addressing structural productivity levels through conversion into higher value chains of production may be enough to sustain economic growth for the developing world, it is not enough to achieve sustainable development,
                    decent employment creation and inclusivity for all. </p>
                <p>Specific labour market interventions from an intersectional gender perspective that takes into account income level and ethnicity are of essence to shape the future of work. Interrelations of gender discrimination, ethnicity and income
                    vulnerability play a substantial role in creating of opportunities accessible for the majority of the population. </p>
                <p>Considering that almost a third of working women are employed in the paid care and domestic work sector, investing in universal social security networks that offer decent work will have particularly positive impacts for women. Research
                    shows that direct investments in the care economy not only reduce and redistribute paid care work, it also has the potential of creating millions of jobs, of which 60-70% would be held by women<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that structural changes that aim to reduce economic inequalities from a gender perspective imply transforming the lives of all the population -women and men alike- to be able to participate with equity in all spheres
                    of the economy, paid and unpaid<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</p>
                <p>Hence, labour market interventions that are designed with women’s needs in the center would have broader positive effects for all the population, while ignoring the gender dimensions of employment has the risk of massive displacement and
                    exclusion. For example, studies confirm that current automation trends in lower value chains will have accentuated negative effects on women if gender informed conversion is not prioritized<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.</p>
                <p>Our challenge today is to design and implement the policy that will shape the work opportunities of future generations. If the goal is to build fair economies, decent jobs and economic growth that translates into the wellbeing of the majority
                    and not the wealth of a minority, direct labour market interventions need to address structural inequalities. Additionally, these need to be paired with universal social security networks that ensure a basic floor of wellbeing for
                    all and redistribute unpaid domestic and care work. </p>
                <p>To achieve these goals a strong collaboration between governments and the private sector is needed. While interventions should be driven by States within a broader development agenda that addresses economic structural inequalities, the
                    private sector should be kept accountable for equitable employment creation that includes marginalized populations, specially during the process of higher technology convergence in the developing world.</p>
                <p>Some <i><b>key points that outline the basics for landscaping the future of work</b></i> in Latin America, from an intersectional gender lens, are as follows: </p>

                        <li>tax incentives to promote gender parity in the work place;</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The later are examples of policy arrangements that can be tailored to specific population gaps and vulnerabilities, which paired with a broader strategy of allocated investment for employment creation under higher value chains and less dependance on natural
                    resources, becomes a powerful combination that brings governments and corporations together in shaping a future of work where we all fit and women’s needs are met.
                </p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>The next generation of work is not to be taken lightly. The present testifies for the consequences of our decisions in the past, hence the challenges and opportunities of today should keep us all accountable in forging an economy that
                    has room for everyone today and tomorrow. </p>
                <p>Addressing structural inequalities of income disparity and employment opportunities from a gender informed perspective is essential in the process of creating inclusive economies. In the context of the developing world, particularly in
                    Latin America, we face high risks of employment displacement as automation trends and higher technology conversion are implemented. </p>
                <p>However, at this turning point in history, the opportunity is still open to take action into the direction of inclusivity. Governments and the private sector alike, have a responsibility in turning the wheel towards equity. The stakes
                    are high and the future of work lays in taking action today.</p>
