                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>Universities across the world have increasingly pursued internationalization efforts. Accordingly, in South Korea, universities have invested billions of dollars in internationalization efforts, such as attracting foreign students and faculty, increasing English-medium instruction courses, and teaching curriculum related to global competence. This paper argues that there are structural barriers to the full realization of global competence in South Korean internationalizing universities.</p>


                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>Higher education (HE) has changed to where universities are increasingly impacted by globalization, including increased technological connections, peoples, and economic trade across borders. Consequently, universities around the world have implemented internationalization efforts. These include initiatives to increase student mobility, accelerate cross-border academic activity, and adapt policies to agendas set by international organisations, including a growing call from international and national policymakers for universities to foster global competence. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which added a section measuring global competence in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests in 2018, defined global competence as:</p>

                .tab {
                        margin-left: 70px;
                    }
                </style>
                <p class="tab">The capacity to examine local, global and intercultural issues, to understand and appreciate the perspectives and the world views of others, to engage in open, appropriate and effective interactions with others from different cultures, and to act for collective well-being and sustainable development.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>The emphasis placed on global competence by international organisations like the OECD and the United Nations (UN) reflects a prioritization of global competence, which is often seen as necessary for the 21st century workforce. For example, the OECD states that jobs in an increasingly interconnected world necessitates future workers to “be open to people from different cultural backgrounds” and to “build trust in diverse teams and demonstrate respect for others.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Given the increasing emphasis of global competence in HE<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup> to what extent is fostering global competence in university students realized? I study this question in the South Korean context, in which I argue that efforts to foster global competence do not fulfill their potential because of Korea’s deep-rooted value of ethnocentric nationalism impedes more recent efforts of fostering spaces of global competence, particularly in universities.</p>
                <h6>Global Competence in Korean Higher Education</h6>
                <p>South Korea<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup> presents a rich context for studying global competence because of its ambitious HE internationalisation efforts. The Korean government has invested billions of dollars in HE internationalisation as a part of a larger strategy to become economically competitive in the global market.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Specific areas that Korean universities have focused on include increasing the number of foreign faculty and students, emphasizing global rankings, proliferating international research collaborations, and bolstering English-medium instruction.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a></sup> In total, Korea invests 2.6% of the nation’s GDP into the HE system, which is the second highest rate in the world.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Korea also has one of the highest rates of participation in HE in the world, with the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Institute of Statistics placing the 2015 gross enrollment ratio for tertiary education at 93%.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <p>Elements of the OECD’s definition of global competency are echoed within Korea’s education policy. For example, in the policy “Korean Education that Harmonizes the World”, there is an emphasis on “Global Citizenship Education” that ‘aims to help individuals understand and practice universal values of mankind such as world peace, human rights, [and] cultural diversity.”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Korea is also committed to the “exchange of globally competent persons” through “customized curricula for foreign students” to “improve the study-abroad environment” and to “enhance the settlement environment for foreigners.”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Universities have also emulated Korean national policies, which intend to foster global competence within its students.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Yet, current scholarship on South Korean HE centers on the level of the abstract, obscuring how these processes plays out for HE’s direct beneficiaries—the students—as well as what this means for developing future theory, policy, and practice. Despite extensive literature written on Korean HE government policies, there is a relative dearth of research on “what in fact is happening inside Korean universities”.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <h6>Methods</h6>
                <p>A key aim of this research was to understand if the potential for global competence was fulfilled for students attending internationalizing Korean universities. To approach this research, I employed a comparative case study approach<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a></sup> across three different South Korean universities with robust internationalization efforts, including increasing the number of foreign faculty and students, emphasizing global rankings, and bolstering English medium instruction.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a></sup> These three different universities (named by pseudonyms for ethical reasons) were Korean International College (KIC), American Branch University (ABU), and Daehan University (DU). The research methods I specifically undertook in this study included 1) Semi-structured interviews of 34 students 2) Critical discourse analysis of 23 university-affiliated documents and 3) Archival research of 2 national curriculum documents. The data collection for this research occurred in Spring 2018.</p>
                <h6>Findings and Discussion</h6>
                <p>In my research, I found that although there were instances where elements of global competence manifested in students, the potential for global competence was not completely realized because of the entrenched value of ethnic nationalism within the sites I studied.Existing literature has shown that a deep-rooted sense of nationalism in Korea contributes to division and even discrimination of international students that occur within sites of HE. Although Korean universities actively recruit foreign students, ethnic nationalism manifests in everyday interactions between domestic and foreign students.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"></a></sup> As a result, foreign students often experience ‘cultural chauvinism’ and ethnocentric behaviours from Korean faculty and peers on a daily basis.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Such observations align with scholarship that traces a lasting legacy of Korean ethnic nationalism coming from a belief in a shared ancestry and bloodline.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"></a></sup> An example of this cultural chauvinism was found when I asked students what they thought about international students. When I asked Sonya, a Korean diaspora student, about her thoughts on how DMU views international students, she said, “Professors complain about international students, because of the quality of the students, especially Chinese students, like they just accept them…like they do pay more tuition but they’re like, I don’t know, it’s a huge money maker.” I found Sonya’s comment that specifically pointed out the Chinese student community to be one of several such comments across the three sites. These comments align with Lee, Jon, and Byun’s<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote"></a></sup> study that found prevalent instances of neo-racism of Korean domestic students towards Chinese international students. According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, Chinese students make up over 50% of the total international student population in Korea.</p>
                <p>An unintended structural barrier was the differing academic start dates at these universities. For example, the different start dates at these universities seemed to contribute to institutionalized divisions between foreign and domestic students. Within the promotional documents of the three universities, there are “spring” and “fall” start dates to accommodate for differing academic terms for students from different country contexts. The Korean academic year begins in March and then ends in February. In contrast, many other academic years, such as that of the U.S., begin in the fall and end in the summer. Although the policy of the two start dates appear to be in place to attract and accommodate foreign students, this policy seems to have an unexpected outcome of reinforcing divisions between foreign and domestic student populations. For example, Jill, a non-Korean student from the U.S. said: “So most Korean schools start in the spring, right? But most international students at KIC start in the fall because that’s how the U.S. system, like a lot of other systems work. So, the KIC students who start in the fall end up becoming pretty isolated from the Korean students.” Thus, the differing semester systems appear to contribute to divisions between foreign and domestic student populations.</p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>The promotional brochure for KIC reads, “students will share a passion for encountering and understanding other cultures and nurturing the cosmopolitan values needed to become responsible global citizens.” This statement aligns with the growing call for universities to foster global competence. Yet, my research shows that although South Korean universities have heavily invested in internationalization efforts, the potential for global competence that are externalities of these efforts can go unrealized. Given that global competence is an important component for the future of work, particularly in developing capacities to collaborate with those from other cultural backgrounds, it is imperative that universities can realize efforts to nurture global competence within its students. Thus, in the Korean context, a re-examination of structural barriers, such as ethnocentric nationalism and programmatic elements, like differing academic calendars, would be worth pursuing.</p>
