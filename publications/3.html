                <h6>Abstract</h6>
                <p>In the next 30 years, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces an unprecedented need for decent work. These jobs should be created by increasing opportunities for private sector organizations to grow. However, despite substantial
                    investment in education over the past decades, the region’s human capital wealth as a share of total wealth remains the lowest globally. This dearth of adequately skilled individuals severely hampers the growth efforts of the private
                    sector and causes economies to stall. This paper explores opportunities for the MENA region to find a solution to the decent jobs crisis by shifting the focus of the education system from an emphasis on rote learning to fostering competencies
                    associated with innovation and entrepreneurship such as critical thinking, creativity, agency, and communication. The article showcases successful examples from other regions, as well as experimental approaches. It concludes by recommending
                    a set of policy changes that can put the region on a path of peace and prosperity by creating opportunities for decent work.</p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>According to the World Bank Group, the MENA region will need to create 300 million jobs by 2050.<sup id="fnref:1">
                        <a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"></a>
                    </sup> This massive need for decent work is mainly due to a large youth population entering the workforce. Exacerbating the challenge is the major redeployment of human capital driven by the technological changes of the fourth industrial
                    revolution. All countries in the region must create 10 million jobs per year starting in 2019 by opening the doors to the private sector as the main driver of the economy. Consequently, these jobs should primarily be generated through
                    entrepreneurship, here defined as “a process by which individuals - either on their own or inside organizations - pursue opportunities without regard to resources they currently control”<sup id="fnref:2">
                            <a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>.</p>
                <h6>Discussion</h6>
                <p>
                    The situation poses a significant challenge for the MENA region, as innovation and entrepreneurial activity remains low across the lion’s share of countries. In the 2018 Global Innovation Index (GII) report, the region scored 34/100, far below North America,
                    Europe, and the Asia Pacific.<sup id="fnref:3">
                                <a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a>
                            </sup> Furthermore, it is imperative to note that high-income innovation hotspots such as Israel and the UAE significantly boosted the MENA regional score. Indeed, the Global Entrepreneurship Index, a composite indicator of
                    the health of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in 137 countries, mirrors the GII’s results for the region. While the entrepreneurial climate is improving across the region, only 2% of countries score above 50%.<sup id="fnref:4">
                                    <a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a>
                                </sup> In Europe half of the countries surveyed scored above the same threshold.

                </p>
                <p>While both the GEI and GII reports discuss a multitude of levers which can be used to ameliorate the situation, both indicate that investment in the educational achievement of young people is essential to improving a country’s ability
                    to generate new knowledge and to innovate.<sup id="fnref:5">
                        <a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a>
                    </sup> However, the real challenge lies in increasing the right type of educational achievement.
                </p>
                <p>In an attempt at defining what type of education could boost private sector performance, the GII promotes a focus on “fostering critical thinking, creativity, and behavioral and social skills.” The World Bank further echoed these recommendations
                    in a landmark report on the state of education in MENA published in 2018.<sup id="fnref:6">
                        <a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a>
                    </sup> The report notes that while substantial investment has been made in education in past decades, resulting in record-setting increases in enrollment and gender parity on almost all levels, it has failed to produce increased human
                    capital and wealth for the region’s 435 million inhabitants. In fact, the focus of the region’s education system on memorization and passive learning over critical inquiry, has contributed to the region ranking at the bottom globally
                    for human capital wealth as a share of total wealth.<sup id="fnref:7">
                            <a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>
                </p>
                <p>In contrast to MENA, South Korea is often celebrated as a champion of economic growth through entrepreneurship.<sup id="fnref:8">
                        <a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a>
                    </sup>However, before introducing a model of entrepreneurial education modelled after those in place in Europe and the US in 2018, the country lacked a systematic approach to promoting and developing entrepreneurship. These models
                    introduced in Korea originated in part from the OECD’s recommendation in the early 2000s to introduce entrepreneurial education across all grades. Several members countries took the advice, and in its 2012 National Innovation Strategy,
                    Denmark set out to promote innovation and entrepreneurship from primary to tertiary level. The country did so by integrating practice-based teaching into mainstream curriculums while also supporting teachers with innovation training.
                    These interventions, which defined entrepreneurial education as “content, methods, and activities supporting the creation of knowledge, competencies, and experiences that make it possible for students to initiate and participate in
                    entrepreneurial value creating processes” have yielded desirable outcomes<sup id="fnref:9">
                            <a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>. These results include an increase in students’ beliefs in their entrepreneurial skills, higher incomes later in life – for those who are self-employed as well as for employees and an increase in the likelihood of the individual
                    wanting to become an entrepreneur or working on innovation projects in established companies. </p>
                <p>In addition to Denmark, Finland, Portugal, and Sweden are other countries that have embedded entrepreneurship education into primary and secondary school curricula. Results have been promising on factors such as the propensity to start
                    a business as well as earnings from own ventures<sup id="fnref:10">
                        <a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a>
                    </sup>. In the Finnish example, entrepreneurship was introduced as one of seven cross-curricular themes in primary education and one of the six themes in upper secondary schools. This approach allows entrepreneurial thought to permeate
                    all school subjects. It has been suggested that this “teaching through entrepreneurship” approach can, in addition to developing necessary innovation skills, also increase the perceived relevance of subjects taught, increase motivation
                    and school engagement while alleviating issues of boredom.<sup id="fnref:11">
                            <a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> Studies on entrepreneurship education in the wider MENA suggest that this approach of integrating the development of entrepreneurial competencies across subjects such as mathematics, sciences, and social sciences could be
                    viable in the regional context as well.<sup id="fnref:12">
                                <a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"></a>
                            </sup> </p>
                <p>In the past decade, many novel approaches to achieving this integrated entrepreneurial competency training have appeared. One of them is the Entrepreneurial Muscle Memory (EMM) framework. Developed by Bozhanka Vitanova and her colleagues,
                    is it based on an interview study of 31 pioneering U.S. social entrepreneurs identified through Ashoka, the World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders, and Forbes 30 under 30. By leveraging recurring themes from the interviews relating
                    to entrepreneurial success, the framework proposes seven core entrepreneurial competencies. These include awareness, agency, networking, problem-solving, resourcefulness, communication, and resilience.
                </p>
                <p>The theory suggests that an individual’s first entrepreneurial memories can be traced back to formative experiences which took place between the ages of 10 and 16. It is further proposed that by applying motor learning concepts, individuals
                    can develop these competencies through repetition of movement, much like the way in which athletes develop mastery. The EMM approach has been pilot-tested both in secondary schools in the U.K. as well as in tertiary institutions in
                    the U.S. Participating students reported increased entrepreneurial self-awareness in addition to an increased understanding of the value of entrepreneurial competencies. While experimental theories such as the Entrepreneurial Muscle
                    Memory provide exciting new perspectives on entrepreneurial training, more work is needed to develop such nascent concepts into fully fledged models.
                </p>
                <p>More broadly, researchers have attempted to conceptualize a learning framework for education that develops entrepreneurial competencies.<sup id="fnref:13">
                        <a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a>
                    </sup> There is agreement that in order to be useful, entrepreneurship education must be tailored to account for differences in culture, context, and circumstances.<sup id="fnref:14">
                            <a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup> Moreover, many also concede that programs should be personalized to the individual learner. Consolidating insights from a multitude of studies, the below five elements of entrepreneurial education could prove a helpful guide
                    in creating entrepreneurship education models for the MENA region.
                </p>
                <p>In line with Thrane et al,, the framework starts with an individual self-awareness element where learners discover their competencies, preferences, motivations, means, and network which helps them gain a deeper understanding of their self-efficacy
                    in the entrepreneurial process.<sup id="fnref:15">
                        <a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"></a>
                    </sup> A focus on individual competencies also serves to personalize the learning experience for the individual.</p>
                <p>Next, a social group element allows students to compare entrepreneurial experiences and learn from each other. Here the students can be turned into teachers, sharing experiences with their peers. Such oral articulation of actions taken
                    and the resulting insights can facilitate the deep learning process significantly according to Russian psychologist Galperin.<sup id="fnref:16">
                            <a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"></a>
                        </sup>.
                </p>
                <p>Subsequently, these individual and group insights are applied across academic subjects to achieve an element of everyday practice, which can establish core entrepreneurial competencies, help transform behavior and create memories of increasing
                    success in relation entrepreneurial undertakings. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, an aspect of value creation can be introduced. Here, learners are initially primed to identify problems in their surroundings and taught to generalize these in order to assess if an opportunity to create value for a broader
                    public is present. If an opportunity is identified, learners are asked to create innovative solutions, prototype, and devise a business model around it. </p>
                <p>Finally, as it relates to the assessment of entrepreneurial competencies the focus should be on assessment for learning, and not of learning.<sup id="fnref:17">
                        <a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"></a>
                    </sup> This implies that the assessment should inherently promote learning, emphasizing the process rather than testing the outcomes.</p>
                <p>A plethora of insights regarding best practices makes devising a well-rounded and effective model for teaching entrepreneurial competencies difficult. Countries must select and adapt those that can work in the local context. In this process,
                    it is imperative that countries in the West support growth markets with both financial and human resources.</p>


                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>Governments in the MENA region have a formidable challenge ahead--creating decent work for 300 million people in the next 30 years. To this end, countries must improve the opportunity for the private sector to be the leading job creator.
                    In order to heed the call from policymakers, the private sector will require skilled human capital that possess the competencies required for innovation. For years, the region has made significant investments in education without achieving
                    the desired outcomes. It is time to shift the paradigm for education in the region to produce human capital that can drive societies forward. Without this fundamental change, where critical inquiry takes precedence over memorization,
                    no model for entrepreneurship or innovation education can be effective. Therefore, the following recommendations should be considered:</p>

                    .tab {

                    }
                </style>
                <p class="tab">
                    <ul class="tab">
                        <li>Shift the models of education from rote memorization which fosters surface learning to an approach based on inquiry that allows for deep learning and unlocks the potential of the region’s youth </li>
                        <li>Introduce entrepreneurship education as a cross-curricular theme across all levels of education, allowing innovation competencies to permeate all subjects</li>
                        <li>Include innovation and entrepreneurship education for youth in National Innovation Strategies to demonstrate the paramount importance of an early start and continuous building of relevant competencies</li>
                        <li>Move away from the assessment of learning, which incentivizes “teaching for tests” to assessment for learning, which incentivizes “teaching for life” </li>
                        <li>Provide all stakeholders, including educators, administrators and parents with the requisite training to create a network of student supporters and buy-in throughout the community</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Governments in the region need to act fast to implement policies that redirect the region’s excellent investment in education towards financing locally adapted models with a proven track record of delivering the type of talent that the private sector
                    needs to thrive. Without the appropriate changes, the region will face further political instability with potentially far-reaching consequences on a global level. However, if the region succeeds in creating the 300 million jobs it
                    needs, it will emerge as a global powerhouse of economic prosperity and peace. It will only get there by pushing the doors to the private sector wide open, relinquishing a degree of societal control. For the sake of the region’s youth,
                    leaders must urgently muster the courage to do so.
